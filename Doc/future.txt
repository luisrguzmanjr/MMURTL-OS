MMURTL is in it's infancy. The idea behind MMURTL was
simplicity with power. I suspect MMURTL will have a
GUI before long. You can bet it won't be a Mac or
Windows clone.  It will also support a greater number
of devices than it does now.

Several people are already working on applications
or have expressed a desire to do so. If this book is
popular enough, a second version will undoubtedly
be in the works. I would like to include user 
applications in subsequent versions.

Loading of DLLs and Device Drivers doesn't work in version
1.0 of MMURTL. This will not be a problem for you while
using MMURTL as a basis for your own operating system.
If, however, you want to add device drivers, you will
have to rebuild the operating system to do this. It's actually
quite simple. Just look at any of the drivers in the system.

The code is not very well optimized right now. For a 486 and the
Pentium, alignment of targets for CALL and JMP (Jz) instructions
should really be on DWORD and Paragraph boundaries for the best
speed. Also rearrangment of register usage would speed things up
considerably. This will all have to wait for version 2 and
a better C compiler. The .PARA align command does, however, work
in DASM, so things can be lined up modulo 16.

I'd like to hear your ideas, but simplicity is foremost in 
my mind. 

Thank you,
