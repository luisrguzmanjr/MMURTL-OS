   1. INTRODUCTION
   
         Have you ever been in the situation  where  you  have  two  serial
      devices (such as a PC and a printer),  which  SHOULD  work  but  just
      don't seem to communicate? Or perhaps you are trying to debug  a  new
      communications  protocol,  and  when  you  start  the  file  transfer
      evrything just LOCKS UP!!!
   
         In such situations, wouldn't it be nice to be able to SEE  exactly
      what is happening over the RS-232 cable? To SEE when characters  were
      received in relation to characters going out?  To  SEE  flow  control
      characters and their effect? To SEE the modem carrier drop?
   
         Wouldn't it be nice to do  all  this  WITHOUT  spending  $5,000  -
      $10,000 on a commercial data scope?
   
         If your requirements are simple monitoring of ASYNCHRONOUS  RS-232
      serial communications, DLM (Data Line Monitor) is for you!!!

      1.1 What is DLM?
   
            DLM is an easy to use DATA LINE MONITOR for use on the IBM P.C.
         It displays DTE and DCE data in a  split  line  format  (DTE  over
         DCE), and records up to 32767  events  (characters  and/or  signal
         transitions) in a circular buffer for later review (If the  buffer
         overflows, the LAST 32767 events are available).
   
            Recorded data may be saved to disk, allowing a  problem  to  be
         captured in the field, and the results viewed at another time  and
         place. Since the data is stored as a standard DOS file, it may  be
         transmitted over a modem  and  viewed  (using  DLM)  at  a  remote
         location. This allows an engineer at the main  office  to  provide
         better (and faster) support to a technician in the field, since he
         can also SEE the problem.
   
            It supports ASYNCHRONOUS operation at  110,  300,  1200,  2400,
         4800, 9600 and 19200 BPS; 5,6,7 and 8 data bits; Even, Odd,  Mark,
         Space and No parity; and 1 or 2 stop bits. The  DTE  configuration
         may be set  independantly  of  the  DCE  configuration  for  split
         speed/format operation.
   
            The configuration may also be saved to disk,  allowing  you  to
         have several "canned" setups for common situations.
   
            In addition to the data line monitor, DLM incorporates a SIGNAL
         MONITOR (LIGHT BOX) for  real  time  monitoring  of  the  hardware
         signals.
   
      1.2 Hardware Required
   
            All that is required to use DLM is an IBM P.C. (or  compatible)
         which has two serial (COMM) ports. A  special  "Y"  adapter  cable
         (described later) must be constructed to allow monitoring of  both
         DTE and DCE data.
   Data Line Monitor                                                Page: 3


   2. HARDWARE SETUP
   
         Before you use DLM, you must construct a special "Y" adapter cable
      which allows it to monitor "both sides" (DTE and  DCE)  of  a  single
      communications line using the IBM P.C. serial ports (COM1 and COM2).
   
      2.1 IBM P.C. serial ports
   
            The serial ports of the IBM P.C. are RS-232 DTE  configuration,
         and will be in either a 25 or 9 pin configuration. The ports  have
         the following pinout:
   
           Signal name                Origin   25-Pin(PC)  9-Pin(AT)
           ---------------------------------------------------------
           Transmit Data       (TXD)   DTE         2           3
           Receive Data        (RXD)   DCE         3           2
           Request To Send     (RTS)   DTE         4           7
           Clear To Send       (CTS)   DCE         5           8
           Data Set Ready      (DSR)   DCE         6           6
           Signal Ground       (GND)   ---         7           5
           Data Carrier Detect (DCD)   DCE*        8           1
           Data Terminal Ready (DTR)   DTE        20           4
           Ring Indicator      (RI )   DCE        22           9
   
       *   In order to be able to record this signal in data capture
           mode, DLM records it as if it were originated by the DTE.
   
            Note that since the PC serial port is  a  DTE,  it  drives  the
         signals with DTE origin, and monitors the signals with DCE origin.
         Therefore, all connections to the line being monitored will be  to
         the DCE signals of the COMM port.
   Data Line Monitor                                                Page: 4


      2.2 Passive Monitor Cable
   
            DLM monitors DTE data on COM1, and DCE data on COM2. Therefore,
         you must connect the input (DCE) lines from COM1 to the DTE origin
         signals on the monitored line, and the input (DCE) lines from COM2
         to the DCE origin signals.
   
            To do this, you must  construct  a  "Y"  adapter  cable,  which
         contains a set of "straight through" connectors which are inserted
         in the RS-232 line being monitored, and also connects the DTE  and
         DCE signals to the appropriate input (DCE) pins on COM1 and  COM2.
         Be sure to mark which COMM port each of the  two  "PC"  connectors
         connects to. If you get  them  backwards,  the  DTE/DCE  data  and
         signals will appear reversed.

          Line Monitor Connector                   COMM port connectors
   
   
               DB-25    Male                    /----- COM1 (Monitor DTE)
               | | | | | | |                   /

       The signals must be connected as follows:
   
           Line   Pin          Port    25-Pin(PC)  9-Pin(AT)
           -------------------------------------------------

           RTS     4   ----    COM1        5           8
           CTS     5   ----    COM2        5           8

           Aux 2*  -   ----    COM2        8           1
   
       *   These signals will be shown in "signal monitor" function,
           but will not be recorded in "data capture" function.
           You may use them to monitor any signals you like.

   3. USING DLM
   
         To set up DLM, connect the  "straight  through"  end  of  the  "Y"
      adapter cable to the line to be monitored, and the "PC" connectors to
      the appropriate COMM ports on the IBM P.C.
   
         Execute DLM from the DOS command line, and  you  will  be  greeted
      with The following menu:
   
                   +-------------------------+
                   | Begin data capture      |
                   | Review captured data    |
                   | Clear capture buffer    |
                   | RS-232 Signal monitor   |
                   | Serial port parameters  |
                   | Disk transfer functions |
                   | Exit to DOS             |
                   +-------------------------+
   
         Each of the above menu items is described below:
   
      3.1 Begin data capture
   
            This option causes DLM to begin monitoring the data  line.  Any
         data or signal transitions detected  are  displayed  in  a  "split
         line" screen format (in real time), as well  as  recorded  in  the
         circular capture buffer.
   
            Each set of lines on the screen (DTE/DCE  data)  has  a  dashed
         "separating" line, DTE data will appear ABOVE the  line,  and  DCE
         data will appear BELOW the line. A  cursor  is  displayed  ON  the
         dashed  line  to  indicate  where  the  next  data  item  will  be
         displayed.
   
            Signal transitions and line errors are displayed as an  "arrow"
         which points UP if the event was from the DTE,  and  DOWN  if  the
         event was from the DCE. One exception to this is  the  DCD  signal
         which occurs from the DCE, but is recorded by DLM as  if  it  were
         from the DTE. This is because each "direction" (DTE/DCE) may  only
         have three (3) signals recorded in the  capture  buffer.  The  DCE
         signals are DSR, CTS and RI; The DTE signals are DTR, RTS and DCD.
         The exact signal or error occuring may  be  displayed  in  "Review
         captured data".
   
            Press ESCAPE at any time to exit this function, and  return  to
         the main menu.
   Data Line Monitor                                                Page: 6


      3.2 Review captured data
   
            In this function, the same "split  line"  screen  as  above  is
         displayed, however it shows data previously captured.
   
            The ARROW keys may be  used  to  move  the  cursor  around  the
         display. The PGUP and PGDN keys may be used to advance and  backup
         by entire screens. The HOME key returns you to  the  beginning  of
         the buffer.
   
            When the cursor is positioned over an entry, it will contain  a
         "arrow" ('^' or 'v') which indicates the origin (DTE  or  DCE)  of
         that entry (In most cases it will be obvious since  data  will  be
         shown above or below the line).
   
            The hex value of any data will be shown near the center of  the
         status line at the top of the screen.
   
            To the immediate right the four "data" flags will be shown:
   
               F   - Framing error
               P   - Parity error
               O   - Overrun error
               D   - Data is present
   
            To the right of that, three signals will be shown:
   
                  DTE             DCE
               ---------       ---------
               X   - DCD       X   - RI
               T   - DTR       S   - DSR
               R   - RTS       C   - CTS
   
            At the extreme right side of the status line will be shown  two
         numbers. The first is the current position in the capture  buffer,
         and the second is the total  number  of  entries  in  the  capture
         buffer.
   
            Press ESCAPE at any time to exit this function, and  return  to
         the main menu.
   
      3.3 Clear capture buffer
   
            This function  removes  any  data  which  has  been  previously
         recorded from the "capture" buffer. It is  useful  to  remove  old
         data before starting a new monitoring session, otherwise  any  new
         data will be appended to the old data already in the buffer.
   
            When you execute this function,  DLM  displays  the  number  of
         entries currently residing in the capture buffer. Press  ENTER  to
         clear the buffer, or ESCAPE to exit and leave it unchanged.
   Data Line Monitor                                                Page: 7


      3.4 RS-232 Signal monitor
   
            This function provides a "light-box", which shows  all  of  the
         hardware signals being monitored (DTR, DSR, RTS, CTS, DCD, RI, AS1
         and AS2). Each signal has a "light" which will be  ON  (white)  if
         the signal is asserted, and  OFF  (dark)  if  the  signal  is  not
         asserted.
   
            Changes occuring in the signal states are shown in "real-time",
         so that the display always reflects the actual state of  the  line
         signals.
   
            Press ESCAPE at any time to exit this function, and  return  to
         the main menu.
   
      3.5 Serial port parameters
   
            This function allows you to set the speed and  data  format  of
         the ports monitoring DTE  and  DCE  data.  In  order  for  DLM  to
         correctly monitor the data line, these parameters must be  set  up
         the same as the devices being monitored.
   
            Sub-menus are provided which allow you to set both the DTE  and
         DCE parameters simultaneously, or individually. Most modern serial
         communications operate the DTE and  DCE  at  the  same  speed  and
         format.
   
            Press ESCAPE at any time to exit each menu level, and return to
         the next higher menu.
   
      3.6 Disk transfer functions
   
            This function provides you with a sub-menu, which allows you to
         load/save configuration or captured data to/from disk files:
   
                   +--------------------+
                   | Load Data Image    |
                   | Load Configuration |
                   | Save Data Image    |
                   | Save Configuration |
                   +--------------------+
   
            Once you select a transfer operation, you will be prompted  for
         a file name. The following special keys may be used:
   
           Left arrow      - Move to left
           Right arrow     - Move to right
           Home            - Move to beginning of name
           End             - Move to end of name
           PgUp            - Clear entire field
           PgDn            - Clear from cursor to end of field
           ESC             - Cancel and return to higher menu
           ENTER           - Accept filename & perform operation

      3.7 Exit to DOS
   
            This function terminates DLM, and returns to  the  DOS  command
         prompt.
   
   4. DEBUGGING TIPS
   
         Here  are  several  common  problems  which  occur   with   serial
      communications, and information on how you could use DLM to  diagnose
      them:
   
      4.1 Hardware Connections
   
            You can easily check out the  hardware  signals  by  using  the

            Connecting the DTE to the monitor cable should "raise" the  DTR
         and RTS signals. If this is not the case, either your  connections
         are incorrect, or the DTE device is not online properly. (In  some
         rare cases this may be a normal state for the device).
   
            Connecting the DCE to the monitor cable should "raise" the  DSR
         and CTS signals. If this is not the case, either your  connections
         are incorrect, or the DTE device is not online properly.  (RI  and
         DCD are not always ON, so  you  can't  expect  them  to  be  in  a
         particular state).
   
            Once you get the above signals correctly connected,  switch  to
         "Begin data capture".
   
            Data transmitted from the DTE should appear  ABOVE  the  dashed
         sepatating line, data transmitted from the DCE should appear BELOW
         the line.

      4.2 Speed and Data format
   
            If the speed of the two sending and receiving  devices  is  not
         the same, no communication will occur. Assuming you know what  the
         speed SHOULD be, it is easy to  recognize  data  at  an  incorrect
         speed with DLM.
   
            Capture a good sample of ASCII data with DLM set to  the  speed
         and format which you think the communication  should  be  occuring
         at, and then look at it in review mode.
   
            If the data  completely  readable,  the  speed  and  format  is
         correct.
   
            If the data is partly legible, but about half of the characters
         seem to be corrupted, the speed is correct, but you have incorrect
         PARITY.
   
            If the data is completely un-readable, examine the  HEX  values
         of several characters (by moving the cursor  and  looking  at  the
         status line). If the data has the high bit set (80-FF),  check  to
         see if it would be readable without the high bit set. If  this  is
         the case,  the  speed  is  correct,  but  the  data  format  (Data
         bits/Parity) is incorrect. DATA BITS is the most likely suspect.
   
            If the above test does not reveal any readable data, the  speed
         is probably incorrect. This will also manifest itself with  "lots"
         of 'F'raming and 'O'verrun errors.
   
      4.3 Flow Control
   
            Many  modern  devices  are  not  capable  of   receiving   data
         continuously at the highest speeds supported on the interface.  An
         example of this is a  printer  which  prints  200  Characters  per
         second (CPS), and has a serial interface running at 9600 bits  per
         second which is about 960 CPS.
   
            Such devices usually have an  internal  buffer,  which  absorbs
         data at full speed, and stores it so that it can be printed  at  a
         slower speed. When this buffer approaches being full, the  printer
         will assert FLOW CONTROL on the sending device, which causes it to
         stop sending data until it is later instructed to proceed.
   
            If flow control is not working properly, the usual  symptom  is
         that the first few lines of data are  correctly  received  by  the
         device, after which symptoms vary from "lost data" to "lock up".
   
            There are two common forms of flow control, one  uses  hardware
         signals, and is called  HARDWARE  FLOW  CONTROL.  The  other  uses
         reserved data characters, and is called SOFTWARE FLOW CONTROL.

         4.3.1 Hardware Flow Control
   
               With  HARDWARE  flow  control,  the  receiving  device  will
            de-assert  one  of  its  hardware  output  leads  (DTE=DTR/RTS,
            DCE=DSR/CTS) to inform the sender to stop sending. When  it  is
            ready to receive more data, it will re-assert the  signal,  and
            transmission will proceed.
   
               Using DLM, you can monitor the hardware signals during  data
            transmission, and see if one of them is lowered to perform flow
            control. You can also see if the sending  devices  responds  to
            the flow control (stops sending), and how quickly  it  responds
            (by noting how  many  characters  are  sent  after  the  signal
            drops).
   
               If the signal dropping appears to have no effect on the data
            stream, then you know that hardware flow control is  not  being
            recognized or acted upon.
   
         4.3.2 Software Flow Control
   
               With SOFTWARE flow control, the receiving device transmits a
            character to the sending device to command it to stop  sending.
            This character is usually CONTROL-S ($13). When it is ready  to
            receive more data, a different character is  transmitted.  This
            character is usually CONTROL-Q ($11).
   
               Using DLM,  you  can  monitor  the  data  to  and  from  the
            receiving device, and check for flow  control  characters.  You
            can also see if the sending device responds to the flow control
            (stops sending), and how quickly is responds (by noting how may
            characters are send after the CONTROL-S is received).
   
               If a CONTROL-S is transmitted, and it  appears  to  have  no
            effect on the data stream, then you  know  that  software  flow
            control is not being recognized or acted upon.
