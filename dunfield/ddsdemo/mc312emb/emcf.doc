    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          EMILY-CF is a software simulator for the C-FLEA Virtual Processor.
       It provides a powerful debugging environment, offering many features:
    
       - Supports full 64K of MEMORY. Any portion of memory can be used  for
         CODE or DATA.
    
       - Hardware emulation mode communciates  with  a  target  system,  and
         allows you to include the physical I/O lines, timers etc.  in  your
         simulation.
    
       - Single step, Multi Step, Animate and Full Speed execution modes.
    
       - Simultanious on-screen displays of program disassembly, memory  CPU
         registers and simulation messages.
    
       - Full screen editors for CPU registers, I/O registers, a two  memory
         editors (CODE and DATA). All of the above may be viewed/altered  at
         any time during the debugging session.
    
       - Multiple breakpoints are transparent to the user program.
    
    
       1.1 System Requirements
    
             EMILY-CF will run on any IBM PC/AT/PS2 compatible system with a
          MDA/CGA/EGA or VGA display, and at least 128K of free system RAM.
    
          - If physical serial I/O is used, a  COMM  port  is  required.  If
            hardware emulation is also used, TWO COMM ports are required.
    
          - Some CGA displays may exibit "snow" or flicker during high speed
            screen updates. This effect will not occur with MDA, EGA or  VGA
            displays.

    2. STARTING UP EMILY-CF
    
          If you are using the optional hardware emulation mode, insure that
       the resident control software (supplied) is inserted into the  target
       system, and that the PC running EMILY-CF is connected to  the  target
       systems serial port  via  COM2.  Power  on  the  test  system  before
       starting EMILY. The resident control software  must  be  active  when
       EMILY "looks" for it.
    
          EMILY-CF is invoked by typing EMCF at the DOS  command  line.  You
       will be greeted with a "welcome" screen which displays a reminder  of
       the command line syntax and the copyright message. This  screen  will
       remain on the display for about 5 seconds (10  seconds  in  the  DEMO
       versin). Pressing any key while this screen is  visible  will  bypass
       this delay, and proceed directly to the main control panel.
    
          If EMILY-CF is given a file name on the command line, she loads it
       in the same manner as if the 'L'oad command had been used from within
       the main control panel.
    EMILY-CF: A PC based C-FLEA simulator                            Page: 3


          EMILY-CF also accepts several option switches on the command line:
    
            /Hardware[:n] - Enables the hardware emulation feature to cause
                            EMILY to interact with the target  system  when
                            performing I/O accesses.  This  option  may  be
                            followed by a  ':'  and  a  numeric value which
                            defines the BAUD RATE to be used to communicate
                            with the target system. Default is 9600.
    
            /Mono *       - Inhibits the  color display, even  if  a  color
                            adapter is present. This option may  be  useful
                            if your monitor/adapter combination provides an
                            unpleasent or unusable display for EMILY.
    
            /Ports:n      - Specify number of parallel I/O ports to provide
                            on the simulated processor.   If not specified,
                            a default of 4 ports are provided.
    
            /Swapcom      - Exchanges the operation of the two serial ports
                            on the PC.  When this option is used, COM2 will
                            be used for serial I/O redirection.
    
        * Note: If some of the EMILY windows appear  to  be  an  un-readable
                washed-out yellow color, try adjusting the color contrast on
                your monitor. Those windows should be an easy to read brown.

    3. USING EMILY-CF
    
       3.1 The Main Control Panel
    
             Once EMILY-CF is up and running, you will be presented with the
          "Main Control Panel", which consists of four "windows" displaying:
    
            - A disassembly of program memory       (Upper LEFT)
            - The contents of CPU registers         (Upper CENTER)
            - The contents of MEMORY                (Upper RIGHT)
            - Informational messages from EMILY     (Lower portion)
    
             All of EMILY'S functions are  accessed  by  command  characters
          entered from this screen:
    
          3.1.1 A - Animate execution
    
                This function begins execution of the user program (from the
             address in the PC register). As each instruction  is  executed,
             EMILY will display the  instruction  being  executed,  the  CPU
             registers, and the contents of internal RAM in the  appropriate
             windows.
    
                When you enter the 'A' command, EMILY will  prompt  you  for
             the number of instructions to animate. Pressing return (without
             entering  a  number)  will  cause  the  animation  to   proceed
             non-stop. Pressing <escape> will return you to the Main Control
             Panel.
    
             The animation will terminate when:
    
                - The requested number of instructions have been stepped.
                - A breakpoint is encountered.
                - An illegal opcode is encountered.
                - The <escape> key is pressed on the PC console.
    
          3.1.2 B - set Breakpoint
    
                This command sets a breakpoint such that  program  execution
             under the 'A'nimate, or  'G'o,  commands  will  stop  when  the
             breakpoint address is encountered.
    
                Up to 10 breakpoints may be in effect at the same time.
    
                You will be prompted for  the  address  (in  HEX).  Pressing
             return (without entering an address) will cause the  breakpoint
             to be  set  at  the  current  program  counter  (PC)  location.
             Pressing <escape> will return you to the main control panel.
    
                EMILY stores the breakpoint addresses internally in a simple
             zero terminated list. This allows  her  to  avoid  searching  a
             fixed size table, and helps  speed  up  the  operation  of  the
             program, especially when there are few breakpoints.  This  does
             however cause the restriction that you cannot set a  breakpoint
             at address zero ($0000).
    EMILY-CF: A PC based C-FLEA simulator                            Page: 5


          3.1.3 C - Change register
    
                You will be prompted for the CPU register to change. Enter a
             character from the following list, ESCAPE to abort, or F1 for a
             reminder:
    
                A   - A accumulator
                I   - INDEX register
                S   - Stack pointer
                P   - Program counter
                1-9 - Parallel I/O port 1-9
    
                After you have selected the register, you will  be  prompted
             for the new contents (in HEX).
    
          3.1.4 D - edit Data memory
    
                This command allows you to edit memory using  EMILY's  built
             in memory editor. There is  no  functional  difference  between
             this and the 'P'rogram memory editor. Having two editors allows
             you to work with and edit two areas of memory without having to
             keep  re-entering  the  addresses.  See  the  "Memory   Editor"
             section.
    
          3.1.5 G - Go: execute program
    
                This  function  begins  high-speed  execution  of  the  user
             program (from the address in the PC register).
    
                When you enter the 'G' command, EMILY will  prompt  you  for
             the number of instructions to execute. Pressing return (without
             entering a number) will cause the program to proceed  non-stop.
             Pressing <escape> will return you to the Main Control Panel.
    
             Program execution will terminate when:
    
                - The requested number of instructions have been executed.
                - A breakpoint is encountered.
                - An illegal opcode is encountered.
                - The <escape> key is pressed on the PC console. *
    
             * NOTE: If you are using 'Local' serial I/O mode, ESCAPE offers
             you a menu of execution I/O functions. See the F3  command  for
             more information.
    
          3.1.6 J - Jump to PC
    
                This command re-positions the disassembly display window (if
             necessary) to display the instruction addressed by the  current
             CPU Program Counter (PC).
    
          3.1.7 K - Kill all breakpoints
    
                Removes ALL breakpoints after prompting for permission to do
             so.

          3.1.8 L - Load program image
    
                Prompts for the name of a file, and loads  it  into  PROGRAM
             memory. The file must  be  in  either  INTEL  or  MOTOROLA  hex
             download format.
    
          3.1.9 N - Next disassembly window
    
                Advances the disassembler to display the  following  screen.
             Subsequent 'N' commands  will  proceed  to  disassemble  higher
             memory addresses.
    
          3.1.10 P - edit Program memory
    
                This command allows you to edit PROGRAM memory using EMILY's
             built in memory editor. This editor operates identically to the
             'D'ata memory editor. See the "Memory Editor" section.
    
          3.1.11 R - Remove a breakpoint
    
                Prompts for the address, and if a breakpoint is set at  that
             address, it is removed. Pressing return  (without  entering  an
             address) will remove the  breakpoint  at  the  current  program
             counter (PC) location.
    
          3.1.12 T - Traceback viewer
    
                In all execution modes, EMILY keeps track of the  last  4095
             instructions executed. By entering the  traceback  viewer,  you
             can examine this recording, and determine program  activity  up
             to 4095 instructions preceeding the one on which execution last
             stopped.
    
                The following command keys are available in the viewer:
    
                Up   - Backup the display 1 instruction.
                Down - Advance the display 1 instruction.
                PgUp - Backup the display 50 instructions.
                PgDn - Advance the display 50 instructions.
                Home - Position to the beginning of recording.
                End  - Position to the end of recording.
                F1   - Display a help summary.
                F2   - Prompt for position & move.
                F3   - Search backward (in time) for address. *
                F4   - Search forward  (in time) for address. *
                Esc  - Exit the Traceback viewer.
    
            * If you do not enter an address, EMILY searches for the previous
              or next instance of the instruction at your current position.
    
                Only the instruction executed  is  saved  in  the  traceback
             viewer, the contents of registers, RAM etc. are not recorded.
    
                The instruction at position 0 in the traceback buffer is the
             one to which the current  PC  points,  and  has  not  yet  been
             executed.

          3.1.13 F1 - Help display
    
                Pressing this key displays a summary of the  EMILY  commands
             which are available from the Main Control Panel.
    
          3.1.14 F2 - Set Disassembler Address
    
                Prompts for  an  address  (in  HEX),  and  re-positions  the
             disassembler window to display instructions beginning  at  that
             address.
    
          3.1.15 F3 - Setup Serial Port
    
                Opens a window displaying the (B)audrate,  (P)arity,  (D)ata
             bits and (S)top bits which are  currently  configured  for  the
             PC's COM1 serial port.
    
                Press B, P, D or S to cycle to the next corresponding entry.
    
                When Baudrate is selected as 'Local', EMILY  will  re-direct
             the  programs  serial  accesses  to  the  message  window.  Any
             characters which are written  to  the  serial  device  will  be
             output in the message window, and any character which are typed
             at the keyboard will appear as incomming serial data. When this
             mode is active, Pressing ESCAPE in the 'G'o command brings up a
             menu of execution options:
    
                End simulation  - Stops the 'G'o command.
                Send ESCAPE     - Send ESCAPE through as a charcter.
                Zoom window     - Switch to full screen I/O window.
    
                If 'Local' is not selected, EMILY  re-directs  the  programs
             serial accesses to the PC's  COM1  serial  port,  however,  for
             maximum  flexibility,  the  actual  data  format  used  may  be
             configured by this menu.
    
                EMILY allows you to "fine tune" a baud rate,  by  using  the
             Up/Down keys. Note that the  available  baud  rate  values  are
             determined by the PC COMM  port  hardware,  and  may  not  fall
             exactly on the value you wish to use.
    
                Asynchronous communication is specified to work properly  as
             long as the device is operating within 5% of the intended  baud
             rate.
    
                For example:
    
                        Desired baud rate       : 1500
                        Allowable range (+/- 5%): 1425-1575
                        Closest PC baud rate    : 1496
    
                In the above example, the baud rate produced is within  0.3%
             of  the  desired  value,   and   is   therefore   well   within
             specifications.

          3.1.16 F10 - Shell to DOS
    
                Activating this function suspends the simulator, clears  the
             screen, and invokes the operating system prompt.  Entering  the
             'EXIT' command returns to the simuation.
    
          3.1.17 <space> - Single step one instruction
    
                Every time you press the <space> bar, EMILY will execute one
             instruction, and update the on-screen displays.

       3.2 The Memory Editor
    
             When you activate the  'D',  or  'P'  commands  from  the  main
          control panel, EMILY will invoke its internal "Memory  Editor"  to
          access the desired memory area. When you are within  this  editor,
          the following commands are available:
    
          3.2.1 F1 - Help display
    
                Pressing this key displays a summary of the  EMILY  commands
             which are available from within the Memory Editor.
    
          3.2.2 F2 - Set Edit Address
    
                Prompts for an address (in HEX), and re-positions the editor
             display and cursor to edit at that address.
    
          3.2.3 F3 - Toggle Edit Mode
    
                EMILY allows two edit modes, HEX  and  ASCII.  When  in  HEX
             mode, your cursor will be positioned in the hexidecimal display
             portion of the memory  memory  dump,  allowing  you  to  change
             memory by entering a new value as two  hexidecimal  characters.
             When in ASCII mode, your cursor will  be  positioned  over  the
             ASCII portion of the dump, and  you  can  replace  memory  with
             ASCII text typed at the keyboard.
    
                Pressing F3 will toggle between HEX and ASCII mode,  causing
             your cursor to switch between the corresponding portion of  the
             memory display.
    
          3.2.4 F4 - Block fill memory
    
                This  function  prompts  with  "Starting  address",  "Ending
             address",  and  "Fill  value".  Memory  between  the  specified
             addresses will be set to the given value.
    
          3.2.5 Up - Move up 1 line
    
                Pressing the UP ARROW causes the cursor to move  upwards  on
             the screen by one line. This reduces the memory edit address by
             16 bytes.
    
          3.2.6 Down - Move down 1 line
    
                Pressing the DOWN ARROW causes the cursor to move  downwards
             on the screen by one  line.  This  increases  the  memory  edit
             address by 16 bytes.
    
          3.2.7 Left - Move left 1 byte
    
                Pressing the LEFT ARROW causes the cursor  to  move  to  the
             left by one byte position. This reduces the memory edit address
             by 1 byte.
    
                If the cursor is already at the left hand  margin,  it  will
             wrap around to the rightmost position of the previous line.

          3.2.8 Right - Move right 1 byte
    
                Pressing the RIGHT ARROW causes the cursor to  move  to  the
             right by one byte position. This in increases the  memory  edit
             address by 1 byte.
    
                If the cursor is already at the right hand margin,  it  will
             wrap around to the leftmost position of the following line.
    
          3.2.9 PgUp - Move back 1 page
    
                Pressing the PGUP key causes the editor  to  move  back  one
             display page. This reduces  the  memory  edit  address  by  256
             bytes.
    
          3.2.10 PgDn - Move forward 1 page
    
                Pressing the PGDN causes the  editor  to  move  forward  one
             display page. This increases the memory  edit  address  by  256
             bytes.
    
          3.2.11 Home - Move to start of line
    
                Pressing the HOME key causes  the  cursor  to  move  to  the
             leftmost position of the line it is currently on. If the cursor
             was already in the  leftmost  position,  it  is  moved  to  the
             leftmost position of the preceeding line.
    
          3.2.12 End - Move to end of line
    
                Pressing the END key  causes  the  cursor  to  move  to  the
             rightmost position of the line  it  is  currently  on.  If  the
             cursor was already in the rightmost position, it  is  moved  to
             the rightmost position of the following line.
    
          3.2.13 Ctrl-PgUp - Move to start of memory
    
                Pressing the CTRL and  PGUP  keys  re-positions  the  editor
             display and cursor to address $0000 at the start of the  memory
             block.
    
          3.2.14 Ctrl-PgDn - Move to end of memory
    
                Pressing the CTRL and  PGDN  keys  re=positions  the  editor
             display and cursor to the  highest  address  available  in  the
             memory block.

       3.3 Hardware Emulation
    
             EMILY-CF supports a hardware  emulation  mode,  which  provides
          access to the physical I/O ports, timers etc. from a target system
          in your simulation.
    
             Before using EMILY-CF in this mode, you must download  and  run
          the companion  Resident  Control  Program  on  the  target  C-FLEA
          virtual processor, before running EMILY.
    
             There is an approximatly 50 MS delay  when  accessing  the  I/O
          ports and other physical hardware. This occurs due to  the  serial
          activity required to communicate the data to and from  the  target
          system.  For  most  applications,  this   delay   is   acceptable,
          particularly in  the  stop/start  environment  of  simulation  and
          debugging.
    
             When using this  (Hardware  Emulation)  feature,  the  Resident
          Control Software should be running in  the  target  system  BEFORE
          executing EMILY. Be sure to specify '/H:<speed>' parameter on  the
          command line when starting EMILY.
    
             When requesting information from the target system, EMILY has a
          short timeout, after which a return value of zero is  assumed.  If
          EMILY seems to "hang" briefly betweeen one  command  and  another,
          and/or all of your port displays suddenly get reset to  zero,  you
          have likely lost (or never  established)  communication  with  the
          target system.
