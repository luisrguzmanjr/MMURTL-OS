    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          DDSIDE is a program which brings all  of  your  embedded  software
       development tools together into a single easy to use interface.  It's
       "built in" features include an editor,  a  browser,  a  communication
       program.  and  a  command  shell   which   runs   other   development
       tools/utilities  from  within  the  integrated  environment.   DDSIDE
       features user programmable options  and  menus,  which  allow  it  to
       interface to virtually any command-line development tools.
    
          With DDSIDE, you can edit your  program,  reference  other  files,
       compile your program, review and  correct  errors,  re-compile,  test
       under a simulator, load and test on a target system with  a  debugger
       or  resident  monitor,  and  NEVER  leave  the   editor.   With   the
       multi-configuration feature, you can then repeat  the  whole  process
       with a completely  different  set  of  tools,  using  the  same  user
       interface, and still without leaving the editor.
    
    2. STARTING DDSIDE
    
          DDSIDE locates its  home  directory  by  reading  the  environment
       variable 'MCDIR'. This variable must be set before  the  DDSIDE  will
       operate. DDSIDE will look in this directory for default configuration
       files, its help file,  and  compile  commands  referencing  the  home
       directory (See CONFIGURATION FILE).
    
          Configuration information is read  from  *.IDE  files,  which  are
       described later in this document.  Sample  .IDE  files  are  provided
       which are pre-configured for the MICRO-C toolset. These files  should
       be  edited  to  insure  that  they  are  properly  set  up  for  your
       preferences. NOTE: The .IDE files provided have  colors  defined.  If
       you have a MONOCHROME screen, use "REM" to comment  out  the  "COLOR"
       statement, otherwise you may not be able to read the screens.
    
          DDSIDE will look for configuration  files  first  in  the  current
       directory, and then in the MICRO-C home directory. This allows you to
       place "common" configurations in the MICRO-C  directory  for  general
       access, and "custom" configurations in the directories containing the
       files to which they apply.
    
          If only one configuration file is found in a directory, it will be
       loaded automatically. If more than one configuration file is found, a
       pop-up  selection  window  will  be  offered.  You  may  specify  the
       configuration file to load on the command line with the 'C=' option.
    
          If a filename is specified as a command line operand, DDSIDE  will
       automatically load it into the editor, otherwise the default filename
       defined in the configuration will be used. In  either  case,  of  the
       filename contains wild card characters ('*' or '?'), a pop-up menu of
       matching files will be offered.
    DDSIDE                                                           Page: 2


    3. SCREEN EDITOR
    
          The focal point of DDSIDE is the screen editor  (EDIT),  which  is
       automatically invoked when DDSIDE is started. EDIT presents a  window
       on the screen which displays the contents of a section of  the  file.
       Editing of the file may be  performed  directly  on  the  screen  via
       special function keys, and the screen is updated so that you see your
       changes as they are being performed.
    
          Any control characters which exist in the file will  be  displayed
       as the corresponding printable character in reverse video.
    
          If the end of the file is within the area shown on the screen, the
       message '*END OF FILE*' is displayed using a special video attribute.
    
       3.1 Entering text
    
             Text may be entered into  the  file  being  edited,  simply  by
          typeing it at the terminal keyboard. EDIT automatically places the
          text in the file, and  updates  the  screen  to  reflect  the  new
          contents. The  position  of  the  terminal  cursor  indicates  the
          position at which the text will be entered.
    
       3.2 Positioning the cursor
    
             EDIT supports many function keys which move the cursor position
          within the displayed image (See Function Keys). Moving beyond  the
          bottom of the screen causes EDIT to scroll forward one  line,  and
          shift the display up. Moving beyond the top of the  screen  causes
          EDIT to scroll backward one line, and shift the display down.
    
             EDIT will perform sideways scrolling of the  display  to  allow
          the cursor to access the entire width of lines  which  are  larger
          than 80 columns.
    DDSIDE                                                           Page: 3


       3.3 Function Keys
    
             The following special function keys are recognized by EDIT. The
          default IBM PC key assignments are shown in (brackets). Note  that
          the keys can be re-assigned in the DDSIDE configuration file,  and
          may differ from those shown.
    
          Forward char (Right arrow)
    
                Moves the cursor forward one character positon in the  file,
             if at the end of a line, the cursor will advance to  the  first
             position of the next line.
    
          Back char (Left arrow)
    
                Moves the cursor backward one character positon in the file,
             if at the beginning of a line, the cursor will  backup  to  the
             last position of the previous line.
    
          Forward line (Up arrow)
    
                Moves the cursor up one line. If at the top of  the  screen,
             the display will scroll backwards by one half a screen page.
    
          Back line (Down arrow)
    
                Moves the cursor down one line. If  at  the  bottom  of  the
             screen, the display will scroll forward by one line.
    
                The cursor may appear to jump back and forth as it is  moved
             up and down, if it ancounters lines which are shorter than  the
             current character position within  the  line,  or  lines  which
             contain tabs. This is because whenever possible, the cursor  is
             returned to the same number of  physical  characters  from  the
             start of the line as is was on the first line from which the UP
             or DOWN arrow was pressed.
    
          Forward page (PgDn)
    
                This key pages forward one screen. (Bottom line becomes top)
    
          Back page (PgUp)
    
                This key  pages  backward  one  screen.  (Top  line  becomes
             bottom)
    
          Forward word (CTRL-Right Arrow)
    
                Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word.
    
          Back word (CTRL-Left Arrow)
    
                Moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.

          Start of line (Home)
    
                Moves the cursor to the beginning of  the  line.  If  it  is
             already at the  beginning  of  a  line,  it  is  moved  to  the
             beginning of the previous line.
    
          End of line (End)
    
                Moves the cursor to the end of the line. If already  at  the
             end of a line, it is moved to the end of the next line.
    
          Start of file (CTRL-PgUp)
    
                This key moves the cursor to the beginning of the first line
             in the file.
    
          End of file (CTRL-PgDn)
    
                This key moves the cursor to the end of the file.
    
          Insert toggle (Ins)
    
                Toggles between character  INSERT  and  OVERWRITE  mode.  In
             INSERT mode, all characters typed at the terminal are  inserted
             into the text. In OVERWRITE mode, only  the  NEWLINE  character
             and data entered at the end of a line is  inserted,  all  other
             characters will overwrite the existing text.
    
          Delete character (Del)
    
                Deletes the character under the cursor, without  moving  the
             cursor.
    
          Backspace & delete (Backspace)
    
                Moves the cursor backward to the  previous  character,  then
             deletes that character.
    
          Current line to top (CTRL-Home)
    
                Brings the line the cursor is on to the top of the screen.

          Help (F1)
    
                Actives the help viewer.
    
          Position information (F2)
    
                Displays the current cursor  position,  including  the  line
             number, actual and character offsets from the  start  of  line,
             and offset from start of file.
    
          End of line display (F3)
    
                Toggles ON/OFF the display of NEWLINE characters at the  end
             of each line of text.
    
          Tag line(s) (F4)
    
                Tags one or more lines for a  later  operation.  The  tagged
             lines are displayed in special video if the  terminal  supports
             it. Once one line is tagged, pressing this key on another  line
             causes all lines between them to be tagged. Pressing  it  again
             on any line of the tagged range removes the tags.
    
          Delete line inclusive (F5)
    
                Deletes from the cursor position to  the  end  of  the  line
             (inclusive).
    
          Delete line exclusive (F6)
    
                Deletes from the cursor position to  the  end  of  the  line
             (exclusive).
    
          Insert deleted lines (F7)
    
                Inserts the deleted  line  text  (From  Function  key  8  or
             Function key 9) at the current cursor position.
    
          Function menu (F8)
    
                Brings up the function menu  to  access  other  (non-editor)
             functions of the Integrated Development Environment.
    
          Enter command (F10 or Keypad+)
    
                Prompts for a line mode command See the section on line mode
             operation. Press F10 (or Keypad+) again to execute the command.
    
          Repeat command (F9 or Keypad-)
    
                Re-executes the last line mode command entered. This is most
             useful for repeating '?' search commands.

       3.4 Line mode commands
    
             When the "Enter command" key  is  pressed,  EDIT  prompts  with
          "Command:", and accepts a line mode command.
    
          3.4.1 Line ranges
    
                Most commands accept a "line-range"  which  is  an  optional
             specification controlling the range  of  lines  for  which  the
             command  has  effect.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  default
             line-range assumed for each command is the "current" line  (*),
             which is the line on which the cursor is positioned.
    
                The following are the valid line range formats:
    
                   *        - The "current" line
                   /        - The entire file
                   =        - The tagged lines
                   0        - The end of the file
                   <n>      - Line number <n>, (<n> >= 1)
                   <r>,<r>  - Range between beginning of two other ranges.
    
                The '+' and '-' characters may be used to add or subtract  a
             constant value from a line range.
    
                    eg: '0-12' <- 12 lines from end of file
    
                If '+' or '-' is used but no range is specified,  an  offset
             from the current line is assumed.
    
                  eg: '+12' <- 12 lines from the current line.
    
                The  line  range  specification   is   entered   immediately
             preceeding the command name.
    
                         ie: '<r><command> <operands>'

          3.4.2 Command descriptions
    
             C - Copy text
    
                   The 'C'opy command performs a copy of the active range of
                lines, placeing the copy directly ahead of the current line.
    
                Examples:
    
                    C               - Duplicate current line
                    1,10C           - Copy lines 1 to 10 inclusive
                    =C              - Copy tagged lines
                    /C              - Duplicate entire file (must be at end)
    
             D - Delete text
    
                   The 'D'elete command deletes the active range of lines.
    
                Examples:
    
                    D               - Delete current line
                    -5,+5D          - Delete 11 lines -5 to +5 from current
                    /D              - Delete entire file
    
             F - File information
    
                   This command displays information about  the  file  being
                edited, includes the filename, the size of the file in lines
                and characters, and the size and position of  the  specified
                line range.
    
                Examples:
    
                    F               - Display file & current line information
                    =F              - Display file & tagged lines information
    
             M - Move text
    
                   The 'M'ove command moves the active range of lines to the
                location directly ahead of the current line.
    
                Examples:
    
                    =M              - Move tagged lines
                    +1M             - Interchange active & next line
    
             R <filename> - Read file
    
                   The 'R'ead command  reads  the  entire  contents  of  the
                specified file, and inserts it directly ahead of the  active
                range.
    
                Examples:
    
                    Rabc            - Insert file 'abc' at current
                    /Rabc           - Insert file 'abc' at start
                    0Rabc           - Append file 'abc' at end
    DDSIDE                                                           Page: 8


             S<dc><search><dc><replace> - Substitute
    
                   The 'S'ubstitute command searches  the  active  range  of
                lines, and replaces all occurrances of the  string  <search>
                with the string <replace>. The <dc> delimiter character  may
                be any character not contained within the <search> string.
    
                Examples:
    
                    S'abc'def       - Change 'abc' to 'def' in current
                    /S'abc'def      - Change 'abc' to 'def' in entire file
                    =S'abc'def      - Change 'abc' to 'def' in tagged lines
    
             T - Tag lines
    
                   The  'T'ag  command  tags  the  active  range  of  lines,
                allowing them to be referred  to  by  '='  in  a  subsequent
                command range.
    
                Examples:
    
                    T               - Tag current line
                    1,10T           - Tag lines 1 to 10
                    *,+5T           - Tag six lines starting at current
    
             W [filename] - Write to file
    
                   The 'W' command writes the active range of lines  to  the
                named file, or to the original file edited  if  no  name  is
                specified. Use of this command also resets the FILE  CHANGED
                flag, allowing exit via 'q'.
    
                   The default line range assumed for 'W'rite is the  entire
                file.
    
                Examples:
    
                    W               - Write entire file
                    *W              - Write current line
                    Wabc            - Write entire file to 'abc'
                    =Wabc           - Write tagged lines to 'abc'
    
             ?<text> - Search for text
    
                   The '?' command  moves  the  active  line  to  the  first
                occurance of the specified string within the active range.
    
                   The default range assumed for '?' is one  character  past
                the current cursor position (in visual mode)  or  the  first
                character of the active line (In line by line mode), through
                to the end of the file.
    
                Examples:
    
                    ?string         - Find next occurance of "string"
                    /?string        - Find first occurance of "string"

             <no command> - Goto line
    
                   If a line range is given without  a  command,  EDIT  will
                reposition the "current"  line  to  the  beginning  of  that
                range.
    
                Examples:
    
                    100             - Move to line 100
                    /               - Move to start of file
                    0               - Move to end of file
                    =               - Move to tagged line(s)

    4. FUNCTION MENU
    
          When the "Function menu" key is activated from the editor, a  menu
       of DDSIDE functions appears at the top of the  screen.  Any  function
       can be selected by entering the first letter of its name:
    
       4.1 Compile
    
             This brings up a sub-menu of compiler functions.  Position  the
          cursor bar over the desired function and press ENTER. Press ESC to
          exit the menu without a selection.
    
          4.1.1 Options
    
                Allows you to select various options for the steps performed
             during compilation. The actual options available are defined in
             the configuration file, and depend on the set  of  tools  being
             used.
    
          4.1.2 Steps
    
                Allows you to select  which  compilation  steps  are  to  be
             performed.
    
          4.1.3 Compile
    
                Executes each of the selected compilation steps in turn. The
             editor file is saved prior to executing the first step, and its
             filename is used as the input file to the first step.  As  each
             step executes, its console  output  is  logged  to  the  browse
             window, and the error log file.
    
                If any of the programs executed by Compile fail to  complete
             properly (Returned a non-zero exit code), DDSIDE  will  show  a
             message indicating which step failed, and  the  DOS  exit  code
             returned. Common return code values under MSDOS are:
    
                2   - Command not found (Check MCDIR and command line)
                3   - Path not found    (Check MCDIR and command line)
                254 - Program found errors during processing
                255 - Program was invoked with incorrect arguments

       4.2 Target
    
             Prompts with a menu of target system options:
    
          4.2.1 Connect
    
                Provides a TTY connection to the target system  via  the  PC
             serial port,  enabling  you  to  communicate  with  a  resident
             monitor. The following function keys are provided:
    
               F1       - Display help screen(s)
               F2       - Send ESCAPE character to target
               F3       - Upload ASCII file
               F4       - Capture output to ASCII file
               F5       - Hotkey to activate BROWSER
               F6       - Hotkey to activate LOG
               F7       - Copy screen contents to error log
               ESC      - Exit CONNECT
    
          4.2.2 Simulate
    
                Activates the external simulator, passing it the last output
             filename.
    
          4.2.3 Debug
    
                Activates the external debugger, passing it the last  output
             filename.
    
       4.3 Options
    
             Presents a menu of various DDSIDE options which can be changed:
    
          4.3.1 Resize windows
    
                Selecting this options allows you to change the size of  the
             EDIT and BROWSE windows. Use the Up/Down  errors  to  move  the
             window boundary, and press ESCAPE when you are finished.
    
          4.3.2 Tab width
    
                Controls the tab spacing in the editor and browser  windows.
             (Tab spacing in the browser may be changed independantly and on
             a file by file basis by using F7 when the browser is active).
    
          4.3.3 Filename
    
                This option allows you to change the name of the file  which
             is active in the editor. You must use a valid DOS filename.
    DDSIDE                                                           Page: 12


          4.3.4 Temp. file prefix
    
                This option allows you to edit the prefix  string  which  is
             pre-pended to temporary files.
    
          4.3.5 Compile from temp
    
                This is a YES/NO switch, which controls how DDSIDE saves the
             editor file before compiling. If set to NO, the file  is  saved
             under its original filename, and the original disk contents are
             lost. If set to YES, the file is saved in a temporary file, and
             the original file (on disk) remains unchanged.
    
          4.3.6 Keep temp. files
    
                When set to NO, DDSIDE will delete each temporary file after
             the step in which it is used completes successfully. If set  to
             YES, temporary files are NOT deleted.
    
          4.3.7 Pause after steps
    
                This option is useful for  debugging  the  configuration  of
             compile steps and options. When set to YES, the actual  command
             for each step  is  shown  in  the  title  window  as  the  step
             executes, and DDSIDE stops and waits for a key  when  the  step
             completes. You may press ESCAPE to halt  the  compile,  or  any
             other key to proceed to the next step.
    
                When set to NO, the step name is shown in the title  window,
             and each successful step proceeds to the next without stopping.
    
          4.3.8 Target port
    
                Selects the PC serial port (COM1-COM4) which  will  be  used
             for   communication   with   the   target   system   when   the
             'Target/Connect' option is chosen from the function menu.
    
          4.3.9 Target speed
    
                Selects  the  serial  speed  (baudrate)  that  is  used   to
             communicate with the target system  when  the  'Target/Connect'
             option is chosen from the function menu.
    
          4.3.10 Upload delay
    
                Selects a delay between characters in files uploaded to  the
             target system. The value is dependant on CPU  speed.  Here  are
             some sample times (in ms) from a delay value of 1000:
                486DX/33=2   386DX/40=5   386SX/16=20
                  286/10=23     XT/10=50   XT/4.77=114
    
          4.3.11 Upload linefeeds
    
                When set to YES, lines uploaded to the  target  system  will
             have both a CARRIAGE-RETURN and a LINE-FEED  transmitted  after
             them. When set to NO, only the CARRIAGE-RETURN is transmitted.
    DDSIDE                                                           Page: 13


       4.4 File
    
             Activates a menu of file function:
    
          4.4.1 Load
    
                Prompts for a new editor file  to  load.  Any  file  already
             loaded into the editor will be replaced by the new.
    
                When prompted for a file, you can enter wildcard  characters
             ('*' & '?'), in which case DDSIDE will prompt with  a  menu  of
             all matching files.
    
                If the editor contains a file with unsaved changes, you will
             prompted with an offer to save it before loading the new file.
    
                NOTE: An explicit 'Save' option is not provided in the  file
             menu, since this  function  is  covered  by  the  editor's  'W'
             command.
    
          4.4.2 Configuration
    
                Prompt for  a  new  configuration  file.  All  configuration
             options will be replaced with values read  from  the  specified
             file.
    
                DDSIDE  searches  for  configuration  files  first  in   the
             "current" directory, and then in the MICRO-C home directory.
    
                If wildcard characters are used in the filename to obtain  a
             menu of files, and .IDE files exist in the  current  directory,
             DDSIDE will actually provide TWO menu's. The first  menu  lists
             the configuration files  in  the  current  directory,  you  may
             select one, or press  ESCAPE  to  skip  to  the  next  menu  of
             configuration files located in the home directory.
    
          4.4.3 DOS shell
    
                Activates the DOS command interpreter (usually  COMMAND.COM)
             without exiting DDSIDE. Use the command 'EXIT' to return.
    
          4.4.4 Quit
    
                Exits DDSIDE, and returns you to the DOS prompt.
    
                If the editor contains a file with unsaved changes, you will
             prompted with an offer to save it before exiting.

       4.5 Kalc
    
             Activates a simple 16  bit  decimal/Hex  desk  calculator.  The
          following function keys are available:
    
                0-9     Decimal input digits
                A-F     Hexidecimal input digits

       4.7 Browse
    
             Activates the browser (BROWSE), which allows you  to  view  the
          contents of ASCII files in the browse  window  (lower  portion  of
          screen).
    
             Up to 10 files may be active in at any one time.  As  you  move
          between  active  files,  BROWSE  remembers  your  position,  place
          markers, tab size, search string and other settings for each file.
    
             Each file can have up to 10  place  markers,  allowing  you  to
          quickly reference multiple locations with each file.
    
          4.7.1 Function keys
    
                When BROWSE is  active,  the  following  function  keys  are
             available:
    
           Up       - Backup display on line
           Down     - Advance display one line
           Left     - Shift display one column to the Left
           Right    - Shift display one column to the right
           PgUp     - Backup display one screen page
           PgDn     - Advance display one screen page
           Home     - Shift display 20 columns to the left
           End      - Shift display 20 columns to the right
           CTL-Home - Position display to column one
           CTL-PgUp - Position display to beginning of file
           CTL-PgDn - Position display to end of file
           F1       - Display help screen(s)
           F2       - Prompt for line# and go to line
           F3       - Prompt for string and search (from current line)
           F4       - Repeat last search (from current line + 1)
           F5       - Position to tagged line number
           F6       - Set a tag at current line number
           F7       - Prompt for new TAB spacing
           F9       - Open another file
           F10      - "Pick" list of last 10 files opened
           ESC      - Exit BROWSE
    
    4.7.2 Usage notes
    
        Most functions may be aborted by the ESCAPE key.
    
        If for any reason BROWSE cannot find the file that you were last
    viewing when it is activated, you will be prompted to enter a new one.
    
        If you modify a file that you are viewing, you should re-select it
    from the "pick list", so that DDSIDE will re-index it, and insure that the
    line numbers are correct.

    4.8 Log
    
        Activates the error log viewer (LOG), to review the console output
    of the last compile step executed. This is most useful for viewing error
    messages, while correcting them in the source file. Up to 50 lines of
    output may be recorder in the output log.

    5. CONFIGURATION FILE
    
          Operating parameters and configuration information for DDSIDE  are
       read from a  configuration  file.  Different  configurations  can  be
       loaded at any time from the 'F'ile menu. The current  directory  will
       be searched first, and then the MICRO-C home directory.
    
       The ".IDE" configuration files contain only ASCII text,  and  may  be
       edited  with  any  text  editor  (including  DDSIDE).   For   example
       configuration  files,  refer  to  the  included  "*.IDE"  files.  The
       configuration commands read from the file are:
    
       COLOR <fgnd|bgnd> ...
    
          Assigns the video color scheme, with a pair  of  colors  for  each
       window type. The window types are assigned in this order:
    
            Editor text window
            Browser text window / status bar
            Edit status bar
            Error status barr
            Function menus/status bar
            EOF markers / tty status bar
            Help text window
            Help selections
    
          The following colors may be assigned:
    
            BK - Black  BL - Blue      GR - Green   CY - Cyan
            RD - Read   MG - Magenta   BR - Browm   WH - White
        *   GY - Gray   LB - LtBlue    LG - LtGreen LC - LtCyan
        *   LR - LtRed  LM - LtMagenta YL - Yellow  BW - Bright-White
    
        *   Note, Colors GY and above should not be used for
            BACKGROUND colors (This will cause flashing).
    
       DEBUG <command>
    
          Defines  the  command  used  to  run  the  external  debugger  (if
       available). The output filename will  be  appended  to  the  command,
       which is then passed on to the DOS command interpreter for execution.
    
       FILE <filename>
    
          This sets the  initial  filename  which  is  assumed  if  none  is
       specified on the command line. If the  filename  contains  wildcards,
       you will be prompted with a menu of matching files at  startup.  This
       default filename is also assumed when the 'L'oad option  is  selected
       from the 'F'ile menu.

            $<string>       - Macro string      (See note)
    
           - Assignments can be spread over several KEY statements.
           - Multiple keys can be assigned the same function.
           - The default editor key assignments  are  as  described  in  the
             editor portion of this manual.
    
       Macro strings:
    
          When a macro string is assigned to a key, the macro string will be
       entered (as if typed) whenever that key is pressed.
    
          Special keys can be entered with '^', '!' and '~'. Eg:
    
            ^J  - Control-J (Enter)
            !A  - ALT-A
            ~F7 - Function key F7
    
          Macro strings cannot  be  nested.  If  one  macro  string  invokes
       another, the first will terminate.

       OPTION
    
          The 'OPTION' statement defines user selectable options which apply
       to the compile steps. The setting of each option may be inserted into
       the compile step  command  parameters  under  "STEP"  programming.  A
       maximum of 10 options (0-9) are permitted:
    
            switch      1/0     Name|On[|Off]       - On/Off switch
            pick        num     Name|Selection[...] - Pick list
            signed      num     Name                - Signed value
            unsigned    num     Name                - Unsigned value
            text        len     Name[|Init string]  - Text input
            end                                     - End of options
    
            - '1/0' defines default ON/OFF settings for 'switch'
            - 'num' defines default 0-(n-1) selection for 'pick'
            - 'num' defines default value for 'signed/unsigned/text'
            - 'len' defines maximum string length for 'text'
            - To allow hidden '$' items in pick lists, menu display
              of pick items stops before a '$'.
    
       REM <remainder of line>
    
          This is a remark, the entire line is ignored.
    
       SETUP <string>
    
          This is an optional  setup  string  for  the  compile  steps  (See
       'STEP'). When defined, the <string> operand is processed,  as  it  it
       were a STEP command string, however nothing is done with the  result.
       It's purpose is  to  provide  initialization  for  any  '$'  commands
       embedded in options which have side-effects.
    
       SIMULATE <command>
    
          Defines the  command  used  to  run  the  external  simulator  (if
       available). The output filename will  be  appended  to  the  command,
       which is then passed on to the DOS command interpreter for execution.
    DDSIDE                                                           Page: 20


       STEP [-][!]Name|EXT|Command
    
          Defines the step used to compile a  program.  'Name'  defines  the
       name of the step  shown  in  menus  and  titles.  'EXT'  defines  the
       filename extension that is assigned to the output file for that step,
       and 'Command' defines the actual command line which  is  executed  to
       perform the step.
    
          If the step 'Name' is preceeded by '-', the step is DISABLED,  and
       must be selected in the 'Compile/Steps' menu before it will  be  used
       in the compile process. If preceeded by '!', the  step  will  NOT  be
       displayed in the 'Compile/Steps' menu. NOTE: that steps not shown  in
       the menu can still  be  enabled  and  disabled  by  '$Y#'  and  '$N#'
       operators (see below).
    
          The 'command' line must contain a complete path and filename to an
       executable file ('BATCH' files can be processed by running the system
       command interpreter). The following special "escape" sequences can be
       used in the command line:
    
            $# (0-9)    - Option (0-9) contents
            $A          - Contents of user variable#1
            $B          - Contents of user variable#2
            $C          - Contents of user variable#3
            $D          - Contents of user variable#4
            $'evar'E    - Contents of environment variable
            $F          - Editor filename   ($f = Without extension)
            $H          - MICRO-C home directory
            $I          - Input file        ($i = Without extension)
            $O          - Output file       ($o = Without extension)
            $T          - Temporary file prefix
            $'string'#  - Include string only if step #(0-9) enabled
            $$          - Insert a single '$'
        The following sequences do not actually substitute data into
        the command, but cause some other action to occur:
        *   $'string'A  - Set user variable#1 to 'string'
        *   $'string'B  - Set user variable#2 to 'string'
        *   $'string'C  - Set user variable#3 to 'string'
        *   $'string'D  - Set user variable#4 to 'string'
        *   $Y#         - Force step #(0-9) to be enabled
        *   $N#         - Force step #(0-9) to be disabled
        **  $V          - Obtain output from video
    
        *   These sequences are most often used in 'switch' or 'pick'
            options, which are initialized in the 'SETUP' string to
            control the following steps.
        **  The command will be run on a blank screen, and output read
            from the screen after the command terminates. Otherwise, DOS
            output will be intercepted "on the fly".
    DDSIDE                                                           Page: 21


       TAB <tab stop interval>
    
          This options assigns the interval (in character spaces)  at  which
       tab "stops" appear in the editor and browser screens.
    
       TARGET <port> <speed> <delay> <linefeed>
    
          Selects the default target system serial interface options:
    
            <port>      = COM port (1-4)
            <speed>     = Serial speed (BAUDRATE)
            <delay>     = Delay between characters uploaded. The value
                          is dependant on CPU speed. Here are some sample
                          times (in ms) from a delay value of 1000:
                            486DX/33=2   386DX/40=5   386SX/16=20
                              286/10=23     XT/10=50   XT/4.77=114
            <linefeed>  = 1/0 to ENABLE/DISABLE linefeed's in uploads
    
       TEMP <compile> <keep> [prefix]
    
          Defines how temporary files are handled. <compile> and <keep>  are
       1/0 (ON/OFF) flags which set the  initial  "Compile  from  temp"  and
       "Keep temp. files" options. If [prefix] is specified, it will set the
       prefix which is prepended to temporary files ("Temp.  file  prefix").
       If [prefix] is not supplied, DDSIDE will  attempt  to  initialze  the
       prefix from the 'MCTMP' environment variable.
