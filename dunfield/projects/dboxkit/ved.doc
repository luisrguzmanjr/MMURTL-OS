VED: A simple Video EDitor

  The VED program implements a simple Video EDitor, for performing assemble
editing between two VCR's.

The VED command:

  To startup VED, simply enter the command: 'ved'. VED will startup, verify
that it is properly connected to a DBOX, reset and zero its attached VCR's,
and then proceed to its main editor panel menu.

  In the event that VED is mis-configured in such a way that it is unable to
start up (ie: DBOX on wrong I/O port, or incorrent number of VCR's programmed),
you may add the 'config' operand, to proceed directly to the configuration
menu before starting VED: 'ved config'.

The Main Editor Pane

  Once VED is started, it will present its "Main Editor Panel", which offers
the following functions:

A)ssemble

  After prompting for verification, this function performs the assemble edit
  of all defined video clips on the playback VCR, and records them on the
  recording VCR. The recording VCR is placed in REC PAUSE mode, while each
  clip is located and played. As the clip is played, the recording VCR is
  released from PAUSE, recording the clip.

C)onfigure

  This function opens the configuration sub-menu:

    VCR assignments
      Presents a panel allowing you to set the DBOX vcr numbers of the
      playback and recording VCR's (1-8). Setting a VCR to zero disables
      that VCR. If the recording VCR is disabled, this will let you edit
      and play clips using a single VCR (but not assemble them). If both
      VCR's are 0, the DBOX is not accessed, and you can enter clip data
      on a system with no DBOX or VCR's attached.

    DBOX com port
      This selection presents you with a menu allowing you to select COM 1
      - COM 4 to be used. NOTE that is you change this selection after VED
	  has started up, the change will not be effective until the next time
	  VED is loaded.
     
    Screen colors
      Presents a entry screen, which allows you to select the colors used
      for the various VED screens and menus.

    Save configuration
      Writes the configuration to disk in the file CONFIG.VED, which is
      automatically loaded when VED starts up.

  When you are finished configuration, press ESCAPE to return to the main
  control panel.

D)elete

   After prompting for confirmation, the video clip selected by the "bar"
   cursor is deleted. Use the Up/Down arrows to position the bar cursor.

E)dit

   Edits the clip definition under the cursor. Use this function to change
   the name, or the starting and ending points of the clip. For details on
   positioning the VCR, see the G)oto command.

F)ile

   Presents a menu, allowing you to "Load" or "Save" the current clip
   information to disk, in a named file. If "wildcard" characters ('*'
   or '?') occur in the filename, VED will present you with a menu of
   all files matching that patterm.

G)oto

   This function allows you to position the tape of the playback or
   recording VCR's. You may use the VCR controls to position the tape,
   or the following keys:
     Up/ENTER   = PLAY       Right  = FAST-FORWARD/Cue
     Down/Space = STOP       Left   = REWIND/Review
     '.'        = Manual     ESCAPE = Terminate

I)nsert

  Inserts a new clip definition, immediately before the one selected by the
  "bar" cursor. You will be prompted with a sub-menu of insert options:
    Insert new clip
      Creates a blank clip, and then prompts you for the name and tape
      starting and ending positions.
    Paste last delete
      Inserts a copy of the last clip D)eleted.

P)lay

   This function allows you to play the clip selected by the "bar" cursor,
   or "all clips", in sequential order.

Z)ero

   Prompts you to select the "Playback" or "Recording" vcr, and then rewinds
   ands zeros the counter on that VCR. Since the counters may drift slightly
   as you move back and forth creating video clips, you should execute this
   function from time to time, especially on the playback vcr, to keep it
   from drifting too far out of sync with its timer.

Press ESCAPE to exit the Video EDitor.
