VAM: A simple Video Answering Machine

  The VAM program, inplements a simple Video Answering Machine. Its basic
functionality, is to watch for a signal (via RS-232 DTR and/or RTS), play
an outgoing message, and then record an incomming message. The program
can be set up to use either 1 or two VCR's.

The VAM command:

  To startup VAM, simply enter the command: 'vam'. VAM will startup, verify
that it is properly connected to a DBOX, reset and zero its attached VCR's,
and then proceed to its main control panel menu.

  In the event that VAM is mis-configured in such a way that it is unable to
start up (ie: DBOX on wrong I/O port, or incorrent number of VCR's programmed),
you may add the 'config' operand, to proceed directly to the configuration
menu before starting VAM: 'vam config'.

The Main Control Panel

  Once VAM is started, it will present its "Main Control Panel", which offers
the following functions:

Go into AUTO-ANSWER mode

  Executing this function causes VAM to:

    - Wait for incoming call see "Carrier detection in "Configuration menu").
    - Play the outgoing message
    - Record an incomming message (until carrier goes away)
    - Wait for next call ...

  To exit AUTO-ANSWER mode, press the ESCAPE key.

Playback your messages

  This function presents you with a menu of messages recorded, showing the
  starting and ending times for each one. You may play any specific message
  by using the Up/Down arrow keys to position the "bar" cursor at that
  message, and then hitting ENTER to play it. After playing a message, VAM
  positions the cursor to the next message, allowing you to play all
  messages sequentially, by repeatedly hitting the ENTER key.

  When you are finished, press ESCAPE to return to the main control panel.

Reset message counter

  After prompting for confirmation, VAM zeros the message counter,
  effectively erasing all recorded incomming messages.

Record a new outgoing message

  After prompting for confirmation, VAM records a new outgoing message at
  the beginning of the tape. Press SPACE when you are finished recording
  you message. VAM will record the length of the message in its internal
  configuration file, so that it can properly play the outgoing message
  and record incomming messages when calls comes in.

  If VAM is configured for a single VCR, executing this function will also
  erase any incomming messages recorded.

  If VAM is configured for two VCR's with a recorded prompt, you will be
  prompted to record the prompt message. Press SPACE to stop. The prompt
  message should be long enough to last throughout the expected length
  of incomming calls.

Play outgoing message

  This function plays the outgoing message.

Configuration menu

  This function opens the configuration sub-menu:

    Number of VCR's
      Selects between three VCR setup options:
        ONE VCR   (Prompt is caller mirror)
          Uses only one VCR, after playing back messages, VAM fast=forwards
          the VCR and begins recording at the first unused position. When
          VCR is recording, caller will see himself.
        TWO VCR's (Prompt is record source)
          Uses TWO VCR's, one for outgoing message, and a separate one for
          recording incomming messages. When VCR is recording caller, he
          will see video source connected to input of outgoing VCR.
        TWO VCR's (Prompt is outgoing tape)
          Uses TWO VCR's, one for outgoing message, and a separate one for
          recording incomming messages. When VCR is recording caller, the
          outgoing tape will continue to play.

    Carrier detection
      Controls how VAM detects an incomming call. You can select either
      DTR, RTS, DTR or RTS, or DTR and RTS. When the speocified signals
      are raised on the RS-232 port, VAM will assume that an incomming
      call is present, and that it persists until the signals go away.

    Screen colors
      Presents a entry screen, which allows you to select the colors used
      for the various VAM screens and menus.

    Outgoing message length

      This function allows you to manually inform VAM of the length of the
      outgoing message. This is useful if you wish to pre-record the message
      on another system. You do not need to use this function if you record
      the message using the "Record a new outgoing message" function in the
      main control panel. VAM needs to know the message length, so it will
      be able to begin recording the caller etc. at the proper time.

    Communication port
      This selection presents you with a menu allowing you to select COM 1
      - COM 4 to be used. NOTE that is you change this selection after VAM
	  has started up, the change will not be effective until the next time
	  VAM is loaded.

  When you are finished configuration, press ESCAPE to return to the main
  control panel.

Exit Video Answering Machine

  This option terminates VAM, and returns you to the DOS command prompt.
