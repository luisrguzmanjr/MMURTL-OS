    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          The D-BOX is an interface translator, which allows any VCR  having
       a CONTROL-L (LANC) port to be  controlled  using  a  standard  RS-232
       asynchronous  connection.  The  D-BOX  handles  all  details  of  the
       CONTROL-L protocol, providing the controlling device  with  a  simple
       and straight forward command set.
    
          Up to eight VCR's may be controlled from a single D-BOX.
    
          The CONTROL-L (LANC) connector on the VCR will be either a  5  pin
       mini-DIN connector, or a three conductor mini-mini  stero  jack.  The
       pinouts for these connectors is a follows:
    
        5 pin mini-DIN:
    
                   --------
                 /          \       1 = POWER (+6-9 V.D.C. @ 100ma)
               /    4   2     \     2 = Option (Unused on consumer VCR)
              |_      __   1   |    3 = POWER SWITCH
               _]    [__]      |    4 = SERIAL BUS
              |                |    5 = GROUND
               \    5   3     /
                 \          /       (Front view of connector on VCR)
                   --------
    
    
        Stereo mini-mini:
    
                  _ ___+-------+    1 = SERIAL BUS
                O|_|___|       |    2 = POWER (+6-9 V.D.C. @ 100ma)
                ^ ^  ^ +-------+    3 = GROUND
                1 2  3              (View of interface PLUG)
    
          The RS-232 port of the D-BOX operates at 9600 Bps,  8  Data  bits,
       and 1 stop bit.
    
          WARNING: DO NOT CONNECT OR DISCONNECT THE DBOX FROM THE  VCR  WITH
       THE VCR POWERED ON!

    2. D-BOX COMMANDS
    
          The D-BOX will prompt with '>' whenever it is ready to  receive  a
       command. Commands  consist  of  two  ASCII  characters,  followed  by
       optional numeric or hexidecimal  parameters.  All  commands  must  be
       followed by a CARRIAGE RETURN  to  cause  them  to  execute.  An  '='
       character is transmitted by the D-BOX  to  verify  that  the  command
       begins execution. After the command completes,  the  VCR  status  and
       counter information is transmitted.
    
          Any command may be prefixed with a single digit (0-7),  to  select
       the VCR to which that command will apply. Once a VCR is selected, all
       subsequent commands  (until  another  VCR  selection  is  made)  will
       reference that same VCR. At power-up, VCR 0 is selected.
    
          The following commands are available:
    
       2.1 ST - Stop Transport
    
             This command causes the  VCR  transport  to  stop  motion,  and
          returns the VCR to an idle state.
    
       2.2 PL - PLayback
    
             This command causes the VCR  to  commence  playback.  Operation
          begins  at  the  point  at  which  the  videotape   is   currently
          positioned.
    
       2.3 PU - PaUse
    
             Places the VCR is PAUSE mode, stopping motion of the transport.
          Has no effect unless the VCR was previously playing or recording.
    
       2.4 RE - REcord
    
             Causes the VCR to begin  recording.  Operation  begins  at  the
          point at which the videotape is currently positioned.
    
       2.5 DF - Direction Forward
    
             Causes the VCR to switch to the forward direction of operation.
          Effective only in the playback mode of operation.
    
       2.6 DR - Direction Reverse
    
             Causes the VCR to switch  to  the  reverse  direction  of  tape
          travel. Effective only in the playback mode of operation.
    
       2.7 CF - Cue Forward
    
             This command places the VCR in fast  playback  in  the  forward
          direction.
    
       2.8 CR - Cue Reverse
    
             The command places the VCR in  fast  playback  in  the  reverse
          direction.

       2.9 FF - Fast Forward
    
             Causes the VCR to commence fast forward winding  of  the  tape.
          The D-BOX does not wait for fast forwarding to complete. You  must
          issue a STop command  to  stop  the  transport.  This  command  is
          useable only when the transport was previously stopped.
    
       2.10 FR - Fast Rewind
    
             Causes the VCR to commence fast reverse winding  of  the  tape.
          The D-BOX does not wait for fast rewinding to complete.  You  must
          issue a STop command to stop the transport (or wait until the tape
          is completely rewound). This command  is  useable  only  when  the
          transport was previously stopped.
    
       2.11 RZ - Rewind and Zero counter
    
             Rewinds the VCR to the start of the tape, and then  resets  the
          tape counter to ZERO. The D-BOX will wait until the  operation  is
          complete before returning VCR status, and  prompting  for  another
          command.
    
       2.12 RP - Rewind and Play
    
             Rewinds the VCR to the start of the tape,  and  then  commences
          playback.
    
       2.13 S0 - Speed 0 (Still)
    
             Causes  the  VCR  to  pause  the  transport.  Effective  during
          playback only.
    
       2.14 S1 - Speed 1 (very slow)
    
             Causes the VCR to  playback  at  the  very  slow  rate  (1/10).
          Effective during playback only.
    
       2.15 S2 - Speed 2 (slow)
    
             Causes the VCR to playback at the slow  rate  (1/5).  Effective
          during playback only.
    
       2.16 S3 - Speed 3 (normal)
    
             Causes the VCR to playback at the normal rate. Effective during
          playback only.
    
       2.17 S4 - Speed 4 (double)
    
             Causes the VCR to playback  at  the  double  speed  (x2)  rate.
          Effective during playback only.
    
       2.18 S5 - Speed 5 (high)
    
             Causes the VCR to  playback  at  the  high  speed  rate  (cue).
          Effective during playback only.

       2.19 RC - Reset Counter
    
             This command resets the VCR counter to zero.
    
       2.20 QU - QUery
    
             This command performs no operation on the VCR, is simply causes
          the VCR status and counter information to be returned.
    
       2.21 GO[+|-]nnnnnn - GOto counter position
    
             Positions the VCR tape to the indicated counter value. The  '-'
          negative indicator is valid only when using VCR's with Hour Minite
          Second counters. You must specify six digits, even if the VCR  has
          only a four digit counter (use two leading zeros in this case).
    
             The GO command will automatically abort if the VCR stops, or if
          no change is seen in the tape counter value for the amount of time
          specified in config register 4. You  may  manually  abort  the  GO
          command be sending an ESCAPE character.
    
       2.22 GT[+|-]nnnnnn - Go unTil counter position
    
             This command requires that the VCR be performing some operation
          which causes the tape transport to move (usually PLAY or  RECORD).
          The D-BOX waits until the specified counter value is reached,  and
          then reports the VCR status. No other action  is  taken,  the  VCR
          will continue with its current operation.
    
             The GT command will automatically abort if the VCR stops, or if
          no change is seen in the tape counter value for the amount of time
          specified in config register 4. You  may  manually  abort  the  GT
          command be sending an ESCAPE character.
    
       2.23 GS[+|-]nnnnnn - Go until position and Stop
    
             This command functions the same  as  the  'GT'  command  above,
          except that a STOP command is issued to  the  transport  when  the
          specified counter is reached.
    
       2.24 GP[+|-]nnnnnn - Go until position and Pause
    
             This command functions the same  as  the  'GT'  command  above,
          except that a PAUSE command is issued to the  transport  when  the
          specified counter is reached.
    
       2.25 ZI - Zoom In
    
             This command causes a camera device to begin zooming toward the
          telephoto position. Zoom will terminate when an  ESCAPE  character
          is received.
    
       2.26 ZO - Zoom Out
    
             This cammand causes a camera device to begin zoomout toward the
          wide-angle position. Zoom will terminate when an ESCAPE  character
          is received.

       2.27 SS - Start/Stop camera recording
    
             This command causes a camera to begin (or end) recording as  if
          the Start/Stop button had been pressed.
    
       2.28 MM - Monitor Mode
    
             This command causes the DBOX to continuously monitor all  vcr's
          selected in config register 8, and output a  new  "status  record"
          whenever a VCR mode changes. This is useful to detect when an IDLE
          VCR  is  operated  from  its  front  panel,  or  to  monitor   the
          termination of several VCR actions at the same time. To  exit  the
          MM command, send an ESCAPE character.
    
             NOTE1: If an error is encountered in polling the VCR's  the  MM
          command  will  terminate.  It  is  the   responsibility   of   the
          application software to detect such  occurances,  and  locate  the
          defective VCR (via 'QU' etc), and either rectify the  problem,  or
          remove the defective  VCR  from  the  MM  selection  list  (config
          register 8).
    
             NOTE2: If MM does abort on an error, the  failed  VCR  will  be
          left selected.  On  successful  MM  commands,  the  VCR  that  was
          selected before the command was executed will be preserved.

       2.29 EXnn - EXecute direct CONTROL-L command
    
             Directly executes the specified CONTROL-L command  (hex).  This
          provides a way to make use of any CONTROL-L  functions  which  are
          not provided for in the D-BOX firmware. The following commands are
          defined by SONY:
    
        BASIC VCR Functions (consumer models):
    
            00 - CH-1/1                     4C - HIGH SPEED

    2.30 ERnn - Execute Repeat CONTROL-L command
    
        This command is similar to EX, except that the command is repeated in
    every CONTROL-L frame until an ESCAPE character is received from the
    controling computer. Also, this command uses the CONTROL-L id code from
    configuration register 1.
    D-BOX VCR CTRL-L Interface                                       Page: 7


    2.31 COr[=nn] - query/set COnfiguration registers
    
        This command allows you to query or set several internal configuration
    registers of the DBOX. Two HEXIDECIMAL digits are required when setting
    the value:
    
            0 - This is the CONTROL-L ID code used when transmitting "normal"
                commands (All commands other than ZI, ZO and ER). The default
                value is $11, and indicates a command from a controller to a
                VTR device.
    
            1 - This is the CONTROL-L ID code used when transmitting "repeat"
                commands (ZI, ZO and ER). The default value is $21, and
                indicates a command from a controller to a camera device.
    
            2 - This register contains the number of counter "ticks" which are
                allowed for overshoot when fast-forwarding the tape. The "GOto"
                command drops into PLAY FWD this many ticks before the desired
                counter value is reached. The default value is $0A (10).
    
            3 - This register contains the number of counter "ticks" which are
                allowed for overshoot when fast-rewinding the tape. The "GOto"
                command drops into PLAY REV this many ticks before the desired
                counter value is reached. The default value is $0A (10).
    
            4 - This register contains the amount of time allowed for the tape
                transport to stop during fast winding. The "GOto" command when
                approaching the desired counter, stops fast winding, waits for
                this amount  of time,  and then proceeds to  PLAY  (forward or
                reverse) until it reaches the exact counter value.  Units  are
                approximatly 1/10 second. Default value is $0A (1 second).
    
            5 - This register contains the amount of time  allowed  to  detect
                movement of the tape counter. Each unit of this counter allows
                approximately 50 ms.  If the counter does not change for  this
                amount of time during a GO, GT, GS or GP command,  the command
                terminates. The default value for this register is $64  (100 x
                50ms  -  approximately 5 seconds).  $00 is interpreted as $100
                (256 x 50ms - approximately 13 seconds).
    
            6 - This register contains the ESCAPE code  which is used to abort
                the  GO, GT, GS, GP, ZI, ZO, MM and ER  commands.  The default
                value is $1B (the ASCII ESCAPE character).

            7 - This register contains "bit mapped" On/Off DBOX control flags.
                You may set or clear these bits to  control  the operation  of
                certain DBOX functions. The BIT meanings are:
                  Bit 0 - Command ECHO (0=No echo, 1=Echo)
                  Bit 1 - Counter type (0=HH:MM:SS, 1=Four digit)
                  Bit 2 - Reverse play (0=Supported, 1=Not supported)
                    Note: When the VCR does not support reverse play, you will
                        obtain best results if you configure register number 3
                        so that the VCR overshoots slightly when rewinding.
                  Bit 3 - Prepends VCR ID to the status messages.
                  Bit 4 - Enable Auto Monitor Mode
                    When set, this bit causes the DBOX  to automatically enter
                    the MM (Monitor Mode) command upon completion of any other
                    command.
                  Bits 5 to 7 are not used.
                Bits 1 and 2 are used only by the 'GO,GT, GS and GP' commands,
                to determine how to read the counter,  and how to position the
                tape. If you are using several VCR's  with different settings,
                you can re-configure these bits when switching VCR's.
    
            8 - This register contains "bit mapped"  VCR selections for the MM
                command. Any VCR (0-7)  which has the corresponding bit turned
                on in this register will be polled by MM.
    
            9 - This register defines an ASCII character code which is  output
                immediately prior to the VCR "status record". This can be used
                to allow an application to easily recognize the status record.
    
    3. ERROR RESPONSES
    
          If an error in encountered in processing a command, the D-BOX will
       output a '?' character, followed by a single digit as follows:
    
            1 - The command was not a valid D-BOX command
            2 - Operands to a command were invalid
            3 - The VCR is not responding
