CHAINSAW

This utility removes an entire directory tree, asking for permission
only once, before beginning.

This is very useful for removing entire software packages etc. which can
have many files and sub-directories. Using the DOS delete command, you would
have to visit each directory (starting at the leaves of the tree), delete
all files (replying 'Y' to the prompt), backup one directory level, remove
the directory, cd to the next "leaf" directory, and repeat the process.

For a software package with 10 sub-directories (not uncommon today), this
means entering at least 50 command lines (counting the 'Y' prompt to DEL).
This is assuming you make no mistakes.

CHAINSAW allows you to remove an entire tree, using a single command, which
requires a single confirmation prompt.

Use: CHAINSAW [directory] [/Quiet /System /Yes]

 /Quiet   - Inhibit informational messages.
 /System  - Removes SYSTEM and READONLY files.
 /Yes     - Bypass "ARE YOU SURE" prompt *** CAUTION ***

 * If [directory] is not specified, CHAINSAW will offer to remove the
   tree from your current directory outward.

*** NOTE *** - CHAINSAW is a *VERY* dangerous program if abused!
If you are careless, you could lose a lot of data. CHAINSAW is much
more potent than "DEL *.*".

To minimize chances of disaster, I've made the command name 8 characters
(the maximum allowed by DOS). It's unlikely that you will enter it by
accident, however, DO NOT GET IN THE HABIT OF AUTOMATICALLY RESPONDING 'Y'
TO THE "ARE YOU SURE" PROMPT!!!

Also, in the interest of safety, CHAINSAW aborts on ANY error If this
happens, fix the problem, and run CHAINSAW again.

Enjoy,
