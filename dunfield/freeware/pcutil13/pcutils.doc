   2. CHATTR - Change file attributes
   
         CHATTR is a simple utility program which allows you to easily  set
      the attribytes of DOS files.
   
         The form of the CHATTR command is:
   
                     CHATTR <filespec> <+|-attribute ...>
   
         The available attributes are:
   
   
           +/-A    - Add/Remove ARCHIVE bit
           +/-H    - Add/Remove HIDDEN bit
           +/-R    - Add/Remove READ-ONLY bit
           +/-S    - Add/Remove SYSTEM bit
   
         Examples:
   
           chattr *.* -a
           chattr \dos\*.* +r
           chattr C:\command.com +h +r
   PC Utilities - DIFF                                              Page: 3


   3. DIFF - A file compare program
   
         DIFF is a program which  taks  two  text  files,  and  performs  a
      line-by-line comparison of them. If more than one differing  line  is
      found, DIFF considers and reports this is a  single  difference.  The
      'r=' parameter controls how many identical lines DIFF  must  find  in
      the file before it considers a difference to be ended.
   
         Any time a difference is found between the  files,  DIFF  displays
      the line numbers indicating where the difference occurs, followed  by
      the differing lines from the first file (Preceeded by '<'),  and  the
      differing lines from the second file (Precceded by '>').
   
         The form of the DIFF command is:
   
                      DIFF <file1> <file2> [options ...]
   
         The available options are:
   
           -d      - Inhibit display of differing lines
           -l      - Inhibit display of line numbers
           r=num   - Specify minimum # of lines to re-synchronize
   
         Examples:
   
           diff program.asm program.bak

   4. DR - Date Ranger
   
         DR is a utility which will quickly scan a disk or  directory,  and
      report on the oldest and newest files it finds. It  is  quite  useful
      for determing the last date/time a change was made etc.
   
         The form of the DR command is:
   
                       DR <directory ...> [options ...]
   
         The available options are:
   
           -? or ? - Display help info.
           -h      - Exclude HIDDEN files
           -n      - Inhibit display of NEWest file
           -o      - Inhibit display of OLDest file
           -r      - Inhibit recursion into sub-directories
           -s      - Exclude SYSTEM files
           -v      - Inhibit startup message (header)

   5. DUMP - File dump
   
         DUMP is a utility which displays the contents of one or more files
      in either HEX/ASCII or OCTAL/ASCII "dump" format. Wildcards (*,?) are
      allowed in filenames.
   
         The form of the DUMP command is:
   
                      DUMP <filename ...> [options ...]
   
         The available options are:
   
           -f      - Pause between each file
           -o      - Use OCTAL dump (default is HEX)
           -p      - Pause between each block
   
         Examples:

   6. DUS - Disk Use Summary
   
         The DUS utility scans a disk or directory tree, and reports on the
      disk space used  within  each  subdirectory.  A  "Cumulative"  option
      allows DUS to report the total  space  under  each  directory,  which
      includes the contents of any subdirectories.
   
         The form of the DUS command is:
   
                      DUS <directory ...> [options ...]
   
         The available options are:
   
           -? or ? - Display help info.
           -c      - Produce CUMULATIVE display
           -d      - Inhibit individual display (total only)
           -h      - Exclude HIDDEN files
           -p      - Pause between each output page
           -r      - Inhibit recursion into sub-directories

   7. EDT - Text editor
   
      7.1 Introduction
   
            EDT is a fully featured, in-memory, text editor. It operates in
         either a line-by-line, or a visual screen format.
   
            In line-by-line mode, EDT performs no direct  screen  accesses,
         and may be operated over a serial port using CTTY.
   
            EDT is invoked with the command 'EDT <filename>'. If the  named
         file already exists, EDT will load and edit it, otherwise a  blank
         file is presented. If the optional '-v'  qualifier  is  specified,
         EDT will start-up in line-by-line mode, otherwise it starts up  in
         visual mode.
   
               eg:     edt thefile.dat         <- Visual mode
                       edt myfile.dat -v       <- Line by Line

      7.2 Line mode operation
   
         7.2.1 Line ranges
   
               Most commands accept a "line-range"  which  is  an  optional
            specification controlling the range  of  lines  for  which  the
            command  has  effect.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  default
            line-range assumed for each command is the "current" line (*).
   
               The "current" line is the line at which EDT is positioned in
            line by line mode, and is also the line on which the cursor  is
            positioned in visual mode.
   
               The following are the valid line range formats:
   
                  *        - The "current" line
                  /        - The entire file
                  =        - The tagged lines
                  0        - The end of the file
                  <n>      - Line number <n>, (<n> >= 1)
                  <r>,<r>  - Range between beginning of two other ranges.
   
               The '+' and '-' characters may be used to add or subtract  a
            constant value from a line range.
   
                   eg: '0-12' <- 12 lines from end of file
   
               If '+' or '-' is used but no range is specified,  an  offset
            from the current line is assumed.
   
                 eg: '+12' <- 12 lines from the current line.
   
               The  line  range  specification   is   entered   immediately
            preceeding the command name.
   
                        ie: '<r><command> <operands>'
   
         7.2.2 Line mode commands
            C - Copy text
   
                  The 'C'opy command performs a copy of the active range of
               lines, placeing the copy directly ahead of the current line.
   
               Examples:
   
                   C               - Duplicate current line
                   1,10C           - Copy lines 1 to 10 inclusive
                   =C              - Copy tagged lines
                   /C              - Duplicate entire file (must be at end)

            D - Delete text
   
                  The 'D'elete command deletes the active range of lines.
   
               Examples:
   
                   D               - Delete current line
                   -5,+5D          - Delete 11 lines -5 to +5 from current
                   /D              - Delete entire file
   
            F - File information
   
                  This command displays information about  the  file  being
               edited, includes the filename, the size of the file in lines
               and characters, and the size and position of  the  specified
               line range.
   
               Examples:
   
                   F               - Display file & current line information
                   =F              - Display file & tagged lines information
   
            <n>H - Set horisontal tab spacing
   
                  This command sets the display spacing of horizontal  tabs
               to the value specified (by the preceeding number).
   
            I - Insert new text
   
                  The 'I'nsert command prompts for  'Input:',  and  inserts
               all lines typed directly ahead of the active range. Enter  a
               null line to exit.
   
               Examples:
   
                   I               - Insert ahead of current line
                   /I              - Insert at start of file
                   0I              - Insert at end of file
   
            L - List text in simple form
   
                  The 'L'ist command displays the active  range  of  lines.
               The  display  does  not  include  line  numbers  or  special
               indications.  'L'ist  is  faster  and  more  efficent   that
               'P'rint.
   
               Examples:
   
                   L               - List current line
                   /L              - List entire file
                   -10,+10L        - List 21 lines, centered on current

            M - Move text
   
                  The 'M'ove command moves the active range of lines to the
               location directly ahead of the current line.
   
               Examples:
   
                   =M              - Move tagged lines
                   +1M             - Interchange active & next line
   
            P - Print text (Enhanced 'L'ist)
   
                  The 'P'rint command displays the active range  of  lines.
               This display includes the line number which may be  preceded
               by a special indication flag ('*' for current line, '='  for
               tagged lines).
   
               Examples:
   
                   P               - Display current line
                   /P              - Display entire file
   
            Q - Quit (exit) editor
   
                  The 'Q'uit command exits the editor.  This  command  will
               not allow an exit if unsaved  changes  are  present  in  the
               file.
   
               Examples:
   
                   Q               - Quit editor
   
            QQ - Unconditional 'Q'uit
   
                  The 'QQ'uit command exits the editor unconditionaly.
   
               Examples:
   
                   QQ              - Quit unconditionaly.
   
            R <filename> - Read file
   
                  The 'R'ead command  reads  the  entire  contents  of  the
               specified file, and inserts it directly ahead of the  active
               range.
   
               Examples:
   
                   Rabc            - Insert file 'abc' at current
                   /Rabc           - Insert file 'abc' at start
                   0Rabc           - Append file 'abc' at end

            S<dc><search><dc><replace> - Substitute
   
                  The 'S'ubstitute command searches  the  active  range  of
               lines, and replaces all occurrances of the  string  <search>
               with the string <replace>. The <dc> delimiter character  may
               be any character not contained within the <search> string.
   
               Examples:
   
                   S'abc'def       - Change 'abc' to 'def' in current
                   /S'abc'def      - Change 'abc' to 'def' in entire file
                   =S'abc'def      - Change 'abc' to 'def' in tagged lines
   
            T - Tag lines
   
                  The  'T'ag  command  tags  the  active  range  of  lines,
               allowing them to be referred  to  by  '='  in  a  subsequent
               command range.
   
               Examples:
   
                   T               - Tag current line
                   1,10T           - Tag lines 1 to 10
                   *,+5T           - Tag six lines starting at current
   
            V - Switch Visual Mode
   
                  The 'V' command causes EDT to switch visual  modes.  This
               enters visual mode if EDT was previously  in  line  by  line
               mode, and enters line by line mode if previously  in  visual
               mode.
   
               Examples:
   
                   V               - Switch visual modes
   
            W [filename] - Write to file
   
                  The 'W' command writes the active range of lines  to  the
               named file, or to the original file edited  if  no  name  is
               specified. Use of this command also resets the FILE  CHANGED
               flag, allowing exit via 'q'.
   
                  The default line range assumed for 'W'rite is the  entire
               file.
   
               Examples:
   
                   W               - Write entire file
                   *W              - Write current line
                   Wabc            - Write entire file to 'abc'
                   =Wabc           - Write tagged lines to 'abc'

            X [filename] - Write file and eXit
   
                  This command behaves  exactly  as  the  'W'rite  command,
               followed immediatly by  a  'Q'uit  command.  It  provides  a
               shorthand way of saving your file and leaving the editor.
   
               Examples:
   
                   X               - Write file & exit
                   Xabc            - Write to 'abc' and exit
   
            ?<text> - Search for text
   
                  The '?' command  moves  the  active  line  to  the  first
               occurance of the specified string within the active range.
   
                  The default range assumed for '?' is one  character  past
               the current cursor position (in visual mode)  or  the  first
               character of the active line (In line by line mode), through
               to the end of the file.
   
               Examples:
   
                   ?string         - Find next occurance of "string"
                   /?string        - Find first occurance of "string"
   
            $<command> - Execute DOS command
   
                  The '$' command executes the specified DOS command.
   
               Examples:
   
                   $dir            - Execute 'dir' command
   
            <no command> - Goto line
   
                  If a line range is given  without  a  command,  EDT  will
               reposition the "current"  line  to  the  beginning  of  that
               range.
   
               Examples:
   
                   100             - Move to line 100
                   /               - Move to start of file
                   0               - Move to end of file
                   =               - Move to tagged line(s)

      7.3 Visual mode operation
   
            When in VISUAL mode, EDT presents  a  window  on  the  terminal
         screen which displays the contents  of  a  section  of  the  file.
         Editing of the file may be performed directly on  the  screen  via
         special function keys, and the screen is updated so that  you  see
         your changes as they are being performed.
   
            Any  control  characters  which  exist  in  the  file  will  be
         displayed as the  corresponding  printable  character  in  reverse
         video.
   
            If the end of the file is within the area shown on the  screen,
         the message '*EOF*' is displayed in reverse video.
   
         7.3.1 Entering text
   
               Text may be entered into the file being  edited,  simply  by
            typeing it at the terminal keyboard. EDT  automatically  places
            the text in the file, and updates the screen to reflect the new
            contents. The position of the  terminal  cursor  indicates  the
            position at which the text will be entered.
   
         7.3.2 Positioning the cursor
   
               The arrow keys on the terminal  may  be  used  to  move  the
            cursor around the displayed image. Moving beyond the bottom  of
            the screen causes EDT to scroll forward one line, and shift the
            screen up. Moving beyond the top of the screen  causes  EDT  to
            scroll backward one half screen, and redisplay the text.
   
               EDT will perform sideways scrolling of the display to  allow
            the cursor to access the entire width of lines which are larger
            than 80 columns.

         7.3.3 Visual mode function keys
   
               The following keys on  the  IBM  PC  keyboard  have  special
            meaning to EDT:
   
            Right arrow
   
                  Moves the cursor forward one  character  positon  in  the
               file, if at the end of a line, the cursor  will  advance  to
               the first position of the next line.
   
            Left arrow
   
                  Moves the cursor backward one character  positon  in  the
               file, if at the beginning of a line, the cursor will  backup
               to the last position of the previous line.
   
            Up arrow
   
                  Moves the cursor up one  line.  If  at  the  top  of  the
               screen, the display will scroll  backwards  by  one  half  a
               screen page.
   
            Down arrow
   
                  Moves the cursor down one line. If at the bottom  of  the
               screen, the display will scroll forward by one line.
   
                  The cursor may appear to jump back and  forth  as  it  is
               moved up and down, if it ancounters lines which are  shorter
               than the current character  position  within  the  line,  or
               lines which contain tabs. This is because whenever possible,
               the cursor is  returned  to  the  same  number  of  physical
               characters from the start of the line as is was on the first
               line from which the UP or DOWN arrow was pressed.
   
            Page up
   
                  This key pages backward one  screen.  (Top  line  becomes
               bottom)
   
            Page down
   
                  This key pages forward one screen. (Bottom  line  becomes
               top)
   
            Home
   
                  Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. If  it  is
               already at the beginning of a  line,  it  is  moved  to  the
               beginning of the previous line.
   
            End
   
                  Moves the cursor to the end of the line.  If  already  at
               the end of a line, it is moved to the end of the next line.

            CTRL-PgUp
   
                  This key moves the cursor to the beginning of  the  first
               line in the file.
   
            CTRL-PgDn
   
                  This key moves the cursor to the end of the file.
   
            CTRL-Right Arrow
   
                  Moves the cursor to the beginning of the next word.
   
            CTRL-Left Arrow
   
                  Moves the cursor to the beginning of the previous word.
   
            Ins
   
                  Toggles between character INSERT and OVERWRITE  mode.  In
               INSERT mode,  all  characters  typed  at  the  terminal  are
               inserted into the text. In OVERWRITE mode, only the  NEWLINE
               character and data entered at the end of a line is inserted,
               all other characters will overwrite the existing text.
   
            Delete
   
                  Deletes the character under the  cursor,  without  moving
               the cursor.
   
            Backspace
   
                  Moves the cursor backward to the previous character, then
               deletes that character.
   
            CTRL-Home
   
                  Redraws the screen image of the file.  This  is  normally
               used in the case of  the  screen  being  corrupted  by  data
               transmission  errors,  or  asynchronus  messages  from   the
               operating system or its users.
   
            F1
   
                  Toggles ON/OFF the display of NEWLINE characters  at  the
               end of each line of text.
   
            F2
   
                  Displays  the  current  cursor  position,  including  the
               actual and character offsets from the start of line.
   
            F3
   
                  Brings the line the cursor  is  on  to  the  top  of  the
               screen.

            F4
   
                  Tags one or more lines for a later operation. The  tagged
               lines  are  displayed  in  special  video  if  the  terminal
               supports it. Once one line is tagged, pressing this  key  on
               another line causes all lines between  them  to  be  tagged.
               Pressing it again on the first  line  of  the  tagged  range
               removes the tags.
   
            F5
   
                  Deletes from the cursor position to the end of  the  line
               (inclusive).
   
            F6
   
                  Deletes from the cursor position to the end of  the  line
               (exclusive).
   
            F7
   
                  Inserts the deleted line text (From  Function  key  8  or
               Function key 9) at the current cursor position.
   
            F10 or Keypad '+'
   
                  Prompts for a line mode command, and executes it. See the
               section on line mode operation.
   
            F9 or Keypad '-'
   
                  Re-executes the last line mode command entered.

   8. EXTRACT - Extract section of file
   
         The EXTRACT utility reads a file, and writes a specified range  of
      lines to standard output, which can be re-directed  to  another  file
      with the '>' operator. If the specified ending line number is  higher
      than the number of lines in the file, all  lines  from  the  starting
      line number to the end of the file will be written.
   
         The form of the EXTRACT command is:
   
                  EXTRACT <filename> <start line> <end line>
   
         Examples:
   
           extract bigfile.dat 1 1000 >small1.dat
           extract bigfile.dat 1001 2000 >small2.dat
           extract bigfile.dat 2001 9999 >small3.dat

   9. FDIR - Full screen directory
   
      9.1 Introduction
   
            FDIR is a screen oriented directory utility, which  allows  the
         entry and editing of commands into a console display of  directory
         files. The directory  display  includes  the  filename,  the  file
         owner, size (in Kbytes) and attributes.
   
      9.2 Command format
   
            The following characters have special significance when used as
         part of the commands entered into the directory display:
   
           @   - Substitutes the entire filename and extension
                 (without directory) into the command.
   
           $   - Substitutes the filename only (without directory
                 or extension) into the command.
   
           ^   - Substitutes the directory path (no filename or
                 extension into the command.
   
           !   - Protect the next character in the command from
                 the above translations.
   
            If none of the above characters are found in a command, and the
         F1 (filename) option flag is turned  on  (see  below),  FDIR  will
         append the entire directory path, filename and  extension  to  the
         command.
   
            For example, if you issued the command:
   
                               FDIR \cmds\*.EXE
   
            The following lines  would  result  in  the  indicated  command
         executed if entered beside the name 'FDIR.EXE':
   
           echo            ===>    echo \cmds\FDIR.EXE
           echo @          ===>    echo FDIR.EXE
           echo $          ===>    echo FDIR
           echo ^          ===>    echo \cmds\
           echo !@         ===>    echo \cmds\FDIR.EXE
           echo !^@        ===>    echo ^FDIR.EXE
           echo !^         ===>    echo ^ FDIR.EXE
           copy !@ @       ===>    copy \cmds\FDIR.EXE FDIR.EXE

      9.3 Function keys
   
            FDIR recognizes and acts upon the following special keys:
   
         Right Arrow
   
               Moves the cursor one character  to  the  right,  within  the
            field of the command being edited.
   
         Left Arrow
   
               Move the cursor one character to the left, within the  field
            of the command being edited.
   
         Up Arrow
   
               Move the cursor up one line, to the previous command  field.
            The screen will be paged backward through the directory display
            if necessary.
   
         Down Arrow
   
               Move the cursor down one line, to the  next  command  field.
            The screen will  be  scrolled  forward  through  the  directory
            display if necessary.
   
         Page up
   
               This key pages backward one screen in the directory display.
            (Top line becomes bottom)
   
         Page down
   
               This key pages forward one screen in the directory  display.
            (Bottom line becomes top)
   
         Home
   
               Moves the cursor to the beginning of the command entry field
            on this line.
   
         End
   
               Moves the cursor to the end of the command  entry  field  on
            this line.
   PC Utilities - FDIR                                              Page: 20


         CTRL-PgUp
   
               This key positions  the  cursor  to  the  beginning  of  the
            command entry field in the first file entry  in  the  directory
            display.
   
         CTRL-PgDn
   
               This key positions  the  cursor  to  the  beginning  of  the
            command entry field in the last file  entry  in  the  directory
            display.
   
         CTRL-Home
   
               Redraws the screen image of the file. This is normally  used
            in the case of the screen being corrupted by data  transmission
            errors, or asynchronus messages from the  operating  system  or
            its users.
   
         Ins
   
               Toggles between character  INSERT  and  OVERWRITE  mode.  In
            INSERT mode, all characters typed at the terminal are  inserted
            into the command. In OVERWRITE mode, characters typed overwrite
            any data already present in the command field.
   
         Delete
   
               Deletes the character under the cursor, without  moving  the
            cursor.
   
         Backspace
   
               Moves the cursor backward to the  previous  character,  then
            deletes that character.
   
         F1
   
               Toggles ON/OFF the automatic insertion of filenames  at  the
            end of commands.
   
         F2
   
               Toggles ON/OFF the display of the actual  commands  as  they
            are executed.

   10. FSCAN - File Consistancy Scanner
   
      10.1 Introduction
   
            FSCAN is a utility for checking the consistancy of the files on
         you disk, and warning you if any changes have occured. An  "INDEX"
         file is maintained, in which the size and  CRC  of  all  files  is
         recorded, allowing FSCAN to verify them at a later date.
   
      10.2 Command format
   
            The following options/commands may be given to FSCAN:
   
           +b      - Instructs FSCAN to keep a backup (.BAK) of
                     the index file whenever it is updated.
   
           +d      - Instructs FSCAN to delete specified file
                     records from the index file.
   
           i=name  - Specify an alternate index file.
                     (Default is "\FSCAN.IDX")
   
           +l      - List the files records in the index file.
   
           +m      - Mark (update) the file records in the
                     index file.
   
           -v      - Inhibit informational messages.
   
            Examples:
   
           fscan                   <== Check all files in index
           fscan \dos              <== Check only \dos\*.*
           fscan +m \dos           <== Record all files in \dos
           fscan +d *.TMP          <== Remove temporary files
           fscan +l                <== List files in index
           fscan +l \cmds\*.exe    <== List only .EXE file in \cmds
           fscan +m +b             <== Record and keep backup of index

   11. HEXED - Binary editor
   
      11.1 Introduction
   
            HEXED is a screen oriented (window) editor, which allows you to
         patch binary files in a HEX/ASCII DUMP display format.
   
            HEXED is invoked with the  command  "HEXED  <filename>",  where
         <filename> is the name of an existing file.
   
            To patch the file, simply position the  cursor  over  the  byte
         which you wish to change (using the special keys described below),
         in either the HEXIDECIMAL or ASCII display windows, and enter  the
         new value. Values in the HEXIDECIMAL window must be entered as two
         (2) HEX/ASCII characters (0-9, A-F). Value in  the  ASCII  display
         window may be entered by simply typing  ASCII  characters  on  the
         keyboard.
   
      11.2 Function Keys
   
            HEXED recognizes the following special function keys:
   
         Right Arrow
   
               Advance the cursor position by one byte.
   
         Left arrow
   
               Backups the cursor position by one byte.
   
         Up Arrow
   
               Moves the cursor up one line (Back 16 bytes).
   
         Down Arrow
   
               Moves the cursor down one line (Forward 16 bytes).
   
         PgUp
   
               Displays the preceeding screen of data (backup 256 bytes).
   
         PgDn
   
               Displays the following screen of data (advance 256 bytes).
   
         Home
   
               Moves the cursor to the start of the line.
   
         End
   
               Moves the cursor to the end of the line.

         CTRL-PgUp
   
               Displays the first page of data in the file,  and  positions
            the cursor on the first byte.
   
         CTRL-PgDn
   
               Displays the last page of data in the  file,  and  positions
            the cursor on the last byte.
   
         CTRL-Home
   
               Re-draw the screen.
   
         Ins
   
               Insert a byte in the file. The value  under  the  cursor  is
            duplicated. All subsequent data is shifted down by one byte  to
            make room.
   
         Del
   
               Delete a byte from the file. The value under the  cursor  is
            removed. All subsequent data is shifted up by one byte to  fill
            in.
   
         F1
   
               Toggles the cursor between the HEXIDECIMAL and ASCII display
            windows, allowing data entry in either form.
   
         F10 or Keypad '+'
   
               Prompts for a command, and executes it.
   
         F9 or Keypad '-'
   
               Re-executes the last line mode command entered.

      11.3 Commands
   
            HEXED recognizes the following commands:
   
         G <xxxx> - Goto position
   
               Positions the display to begin at specified address (xxxx).
   
            Examples:
   
                   g100            - Position to 0100
                   g1000           - Position to 1000
   
         Q - Quit (exit) editor
   
               The 'Q'uit command exits the editor. This command  will  not
            allow an exit if unsaved changes are present in the file.
   
            Examples:
   
                   Q               - Quit editor
   
         QQ - Unconditional 'Q'uit
   
               The 'QQ'uit command exits the editor unconditionaly.
   
            Examples:
   
                   QQ              - Quit unconditionaly.
   
         W [filename] - Write to file
   
               The 'W' command writes the contents of the  edit  buffer  to
            the named file, or to the original file edited if  no  name  is
            specified. Use of this command also  resets  the  FILE  CHANGED
            flag, allowing exit via 'q'.
   
            Examples:
   
                   W               - Write file
                   Wabc            - Write file to 'abc'
   
         X [filename] - Write file and eXit
   
               This  command  behaves  exactly  as  the  'W'rite   command,
            followed  immediatly  by  a  'Q'uit  command.  It  provides   a
            shorthand way of saving your file and leaving the editor.
   
            Examples:
   
                   X               - Write file & exit
                   Xabc            - Write to 'abc' and exit

   12. LOCATE - Text file search
   
         LOCATE is a fast utility for finding  specified  strings  in  text
      files. Unlike most other such utilities, LOCATE allows you to  search
      for several strings at the same time.
   
         The format of the LOCATE command is:
   
                  LOCATE <filespec> "text"... [options ...]
   
         The available options are:
   
           +c      - Use CASE-SENSITIVE search
           +r      - Recurse into SUB-DIRECTORIES
           +t      - Display lines where text is found
           -v      - Inhibit line number display
   
         Examples:
   
           locate *.c "printf" "svanf"
           locate C:\*.c "strcpy" +r

   13. OFF - CRT screen Saver
   
         OFF is a manually operated CRT screen saved.  When  executed,  OFF
      saves the current contents of the CRT screen,  clears  it,  and  then
      displays a "happy face" character which moves around at random.  This
      saves the  phosphors  of  the  CRT  from  becoming  "burned"  due  to
      characters being displayed in one position for too long. Pressing any
      key will restore the saved CRT screen, and terminate OFF.
   
         The form of the OFF command is:
   
                                     OFF
   
         This command should be executed whenever you are going to be  away
      from your computer for any length of time.

   14. RETAB - File Re-Tabulator
   
      14.1 Introduction
   
            RETAB is a very useful utility  which  re-tabulates  files,  so
         that they will be correctly formatted when viewed on systems using
         different tab stops. RETAB writes its output to the console, which
         may be re-directed to a file using the DOS '>' operation.
   
            This is very useful  when  moving  files  from  one  system  to
         another (For example: QNX uses tabs every four spaces, and  MS-DOS
         uses tabs every 8 spaces).
   
      14.2 Command format
   
            The format of the RETAB command is:
   
          RETAB [options] <filename> [options <filename>]... >output
   
            The available options are:
   
           -f      - Inhibit filling with spaces. If this option is
                     specified, RETAB will only format the file as
                     close to the original format as it can using the
                     output tab stops only. If not specified, RETAB
                     will format the file to exactly the same visual
                     format, using spaces to fill in any partial tabs.
   
           -s      - Causes RETAB to convert any strings of spaces in
                     the input file to tabs where possible.
   
           i=n,... - Specifies the input file tab stops.
   
           o=n,... - Specifies the output file tab stops.
   
       NOTE: RETAB processes multiple files, and allows the tab settings
   to be defined for each file. The '-f -s i= and o=' parameters must be
   specified BEFORE the file name where they are to have effect.
   
       If more tabs are present in the input or output file than were specified
   (using I= and O=), RETAB assumes that the tabs continue at the spacing of
   the last two stops. Therefore, if the tabs are at regular intervals, only
   the first tab stop need be given.
   
       Both input and output tabs default to 8 space intervals.
   
       If 'O=0' is specified, RETAB will convert all tabs in the input file to
   the appriopriate number of spaces in the output file.
   
       Examples:
   
           retab i=4 tab4.fil >tab8.fil
           retab o=4 tab8.fil >tab4.fil
           retab i=4 o=2 tab4.file i=8 tab8.fil >tab2.fil
           retab o=0 tab8.file >space.fil

   15. SIZE - Report file sizes
   
         The SIZE utility reads one or more files, and counts the number of
      lines and characters in each one.
   
         If no files are specified, SIZE reads from  the  "standard  input"
      device, allowing it to be used in a "pipe" to process the output from
      another command.
   
         If more than one filename is specified, SIZE will  also  report  a
      "grand  total"  of  the  total  numbers  of  lines   and   characters
      encountered.
   
         The form of the SIZE command is:
   
                             SIZE [filename ...]

   17. WDIR - Walk Directory
   
      17.1 Introduction
   
            This utility walks through a directory, executing one  or  more
         commands on files matching a specified pattern. Its main use is to
         provide "wildcard" capability to commands which  do  not  directly
         support wildcards, although  it  can  be  quite  useful  in  other
         situations as well.
   
      17.2 Command format
   
            The format of the WDIR command is:
   
                    WDIR <filespec> "command..." [options]
   
            The following options are available:
   
           +r      - Recurse into sub-directories. When this option
                     is specified, WDIR will search sub-directories
                     for matching files.
   
           -v      - Inhibit display of commands executed.
   
           +m      - Use multiple (wildcard) forms of commands.
                     This options is used with '+r' to cause a
                     single command to be executed once in all
                     sub-directories that have matching files.
   
            The following characters have special significance when used as
         part of the commands given to WDIR.
   
           @   - Substitutes the entire filename and extension
                 (without directory) into the command.
   
           $   - Substitutes the filename only (without directory
                 or extension) into the command.
   
           ^   - Substitutes the directory path (no filename or
                 extension into the command.
   
           !   - Protect the next character in the command from
                 the above translations.
   
            If none of the above characters are found in  a  command,  WDIR
         will append the entire directory path, filename and  extension  to
         the command.
   
            NOTE: WDIR accepts and executes multiple commands.
   
            Examples:
   
           WDIR *.c "del" +r           <=== One "DEL" for each FILE
           WDIR *.c "del" +r +m        <=== One "DEL" for each DIRECTORY
           WDIR \cmds\*.BAT "copy" "delete"
           (Copy all ".BAT" files from \cmds and then delete them)
