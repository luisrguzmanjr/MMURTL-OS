   1. INTRODUCTION
   
         TYPESET is a simplified document processor for use on  ASCII  text
      systems.  It  will  perform  automatic   formatting,   justification,
      underlining, centering, indenting, and has adjustable margins. It  is
      particularily useful in the PC environment for creating nice  looking
      ASCII documents for distrubution on disk.
   
         TYPESET accepts as parameters, names for files  which  are  to  be
      formatted. The input files are assumed to have the suffix '.doc', and
      the output file is created with the suffix '.txt'.
   
         TYPESET is used and controlled by commands imbedded in the  source
      file.
   
   2. Using TYPESET
   
      2.1 Qualiifers
   
            TYPESET accepts the following qualifiers in the TYPESET command
         invocation.
   
         +c - Causes TYPESET to treat all input files as separate documents
              which are to be processed  and  concatinated  into  a  single
              file. Each document gets its  own  title  page.  By  default,
              TYPESET assumes all files are one large document,  with  only
              one title page.
   
         +t - Causes TYPESET to write to the standard output  file  instead
              of the ".txt" file which is normally used.
   
         -v - Prevents TYPESET from  displaying  progress  messages  as  it
              processes the documents.
   
         -w - Prevents TYPESET from displaying  warning  messages  when  it
              encounters situations which may not format properly.

      2.2 Commands
   
            Any lines in the input file which have a '.' in  column  number
         one, are interpreted as TYPESET  commands.  All  TYPESET  commands
         consist of a '.', followed by a single character command name, and
         optional operands. Most parameters do NOT  have  to  be  separated
         from the command by spaces.
   
            ".C <text>"
   
               The '.C' command, centers the text on the remainder  of  the
            line, so that it appears in the middle of the page.
   
            ".D[+|-]"
   
               The '.D' command enables  ('+')  or  disables  ('-')  double
            spaced output.
   
            ".E"
   
               The '.E' command forces an EXTRA page  to  be  ejected,  the
            effect is similar to the page (.P) command, except that the new
            page has no title, or page number.
   
            ".F[+|-]"
   
               The '.F'  command,  enables  ('+')  or  disables  ('-')  the
            automatic formating of the  document  text.  If  formatting  is
            enabled, TYPESET automatically fills each  line  with  as  much
            text as it can, without overflowing the  page  width.  If  this
            option is disabled,  the  input  lines  appear  in  the  output
            exactly as they occur in  the  input  file  (Except  offset  by
            MARGIN, and underlined, centered etc).  Formatting  enabled  is
            the default condition when TYPESET is first invoked.
   
            ".I[+|-][<n>][<text>]"
   
               The '.I' command, sets the INDENT value. If  <n>  is  given,
            then all lines output by TYPESET, excluding titles and centered
            lines, will be indented  by  <n>  spaces.  If  <text>  is  also
            given,then the new indent value will be in effect for this line
            only, as the reaminder of the line is printed.  If  the  indent
            value is preceded by '+' or '-', then the current indent  value
            is adjusted by that value (positive or negative). If  just  '+'
            or '-' is given as  the  operand,  then  the  indent  value  is
            adjusted by the current value of the indent size  (See  '.=I').
            If no numeric operand is given to '.I', then the indent is  not
            changed, but a new line is forced, just as if the indent  value
            had been changed.

            ".J[+|-]"
   
               The '.J'  command,  enables  ('+')  or  disables  ('-')  the
            automatic right justification of the formatted  document  text.
            If justification is enabled, TYPESET will attempt  to  line  up
            all formatted text at the  right  page  boundary  by  inserting
            extra spaces between the words toward the end of each line.  If
            TYPESET is unable to  obtain  enough  spaces  in  this  manner,
            allowing a maximum of two extra spaces  between  each  word,  a
            warning message indicating that the justification is incomplete
            will be printed. By  default,  justification  is  enabled  when
            TYPESET is first  started  up.  Justification  will  not  occur
            unless formatting is enabled.
   
            ".P"
   
               The '.P' command, forces a page eject at this point  in  the
            output file. A new page is forced, complete with title and page
            numbers
   
            ".S[<n>]"
   
               The '.S' command, causes <n> blank lines to be  inserted  in
            the output file. If the blanks lines would  continue  past  the
            end of the page, TYPESET does NOT continue the blank  lines  on
            the next page. If  no  operand  is  given,  TYPESET  assumes  a
            default value of one blank line.
   
            ".T <text>"
   
               The '.T' command, sets the TITLE to the  text  contained  in
            the remainder of the line. The title is printed at the  top  of
            every page, except the first one (The title page), and defaults
            to the name of the file if it is not explicitly set with a '.T'
            command.
   
            ".U[+|-]
   
               This command enables ('+') or disabled ('-') the underlining
            of text. Following a '.U+' command, all text will be underlined
            until a '.U-' command is encountered.
   
            "._<string>"
   
               This command, causes the remainder of the line to be printed
            on a separate line by itself, underlined.
   
            "..<filename>"
   
               This command causes the specified file to be  "included"  in
            the document input. The file  will  be  processed  and  output,
            after which processing of the original file will resume.
   
            ".* <comment text>"
   
               The '.*' command is a comment, the remainder of that line is
            ignored by TYPESET
   TYPESET USERS GUIDE                                              Page: 4


            ".=<option>[+|-]<n>"
   
               The '.=' command, sets some of TYPESETS internal values. The
            available values are:
   
            ".=M[+|-]<n>"
   
               This command, sets the left page MARGIN. If  <n>  is  given,
            then all lines output by TYPESET, including titles and centered
            lines will be offset by <n> spaces from the  lefthand  edge  of
            the page. The '+' and '-' operators can be used  to  perform  a
            relative margin adjustment, and if no values are given,  margin
            is adjusted (positive or negative) by the currently set  indent
            size.
   
            ".=P[+|-]<n>"
   
               Sets the page number which will appear at  the  top  of  the
            next page. All subsequent page numbers will be sequential  from
            this value, unless another '.=P' command is issued.
   
            ".=I[+|-]<n>"
   
               This command sets the indent size. The indent  size  is  the
            number of spaces which are used to indent lines, and  also  the
            size of  the  default  relative  spacing  adjustment  for  some
            commands. Any line which begins with a space or a tab character
            is automatically indented by a number of spaces  equal  to  the
            indent size. The default value of the indent size is three.
   
            ".=L[+|-]<n>"
   
               The '.=L' command, sets the number of lines to be printed on
            a page. The default value is 60 lines, '+' and '-' can be  used
            to perform a relative page adjustment.
   
            ".=T[+|-]<n>"
   
               This  command  sets  the  number  of  section  levels   (See
            Sectioning), which will be printed in the table of contents  to
            the supplied value. Setting this value to zero will disable the
            table of contents, and none will be printed.  By  default,  two
            levels of sections are displayed in the table of contents.
   
            ".=W[+|-]<n>"
   
               The '.=W' command, sets the width of the page, in  character
            positions. The page width is  used  by  TYPESET,  to  determine
            TITLE length, and the position of centered  lines  (See  '.C').
            The default value for the page width is 72 characters. The  '+'
            and '-'  operators  can  be  used  to  perform  relative  width
            adjustments,  default  relative  adjustment  is  currently  set
            indent size.

            ".=><section number>"
   
               Sets the current section  number  (See  Sectioning)  to  the
            supplied value, '+' and '-' can be used in each  section  field
            to perform relative section adjustment. Any sections for  which
            the '.' separator is supplied,  but  no  value  is  given  will
            remain unchanged.
                                EG: '.=> ..+1'
               The above command advances the number of the  third  section
            level by one. Note that this command sets the section number of
            the CURRENT section, and the next section number displayed will
            follow this value according to the rules of section numbering.
   
      2.3 Sectioning
   
            The character '>', when encountered at the start of a  line  in
         the input file, indicates to TYPESET that a new section is  to  be
         defined. The number of '>'s found indicates the section depth. The
         '>' characters must be followed by the section title.
   
            When a new section is started,  TYPESET  automatically  inserts
         the appropriate section number, and indents the section  according
         to its depth, and the setting of the indent size  (see  '.=i<n>').
         Section and subsection numbers are displayed with '.'  separators,
         and are incremented sequentially for  each  section  at  the  same
         depth which is encountered.
   
            At the end of the document, TYPESET will generate  a  table  of
         contents, based on the sections and section titles. If no sections
         are  used  within  a  document,  no  table  of  contents  will  be
         generated. The margin, indent, title and other parameters used for
         the table of contents are assumed at the END of the  document,  so
         if any of these parameters are to be changed before the  table  of
         contents is printed, they must be specified  at  the  END  of  the
         input file.
