OFF.COM     - Manual scren-saver

RETAB.COM   -   Retabulates files to different tab stops
            Options:
                -f      = Inhibit filling with spaces
                -s      = Convert spaces to tabs where possible
                i=n,... = Specify input tab stops
                o=n,... = Specify output tab stops
            Notes:
                RETAB processes multiple files, and allows the tab settings
                to be defined for each file. The '-f -s i= and o=' parameters
                must be specified BEFORE the file name where they are to have
                effect.

                If more tabs are present in the input or output file than were
                specified (using I= and O=), RETAB assumes that the tabs
                continue at the spacing of the last two stops. Therefore, if
                the tabs are at regular intervals, only the first tab stop need
                be given.

                Both input and output tabs default to 8 space intervals.

                If 'O=0' is specified, RETAB will convert all tabs in the input
                file to the appriopriate number of spaces.
            Examples:
                retab i=4 tab4.fil >tab8.fil
                retab o=4 tab8.fil >tab4.fil
                retab i=4 o=2 tab4.file i=8 tab8.fil >tab2.fil
                retab o=0 tab8.file >space.fil

                +m  = Use multiple (wildcard) forms of commands
                      (Used with '+r' to cause a command to be executed
                      once in all sub-directories that have matching files)
            Notes:
                Accepts multiple commands.
                Special characters are available, same as FDIR. Ie: '@$^!'
