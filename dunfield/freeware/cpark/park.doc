    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          I recently put together an XT computer out of spare  parts  I  had
       lying around, and ended up with a rather weird disk configuration.  I
       had this old 12 Meg MEMOREX disk drive sitting on  the  shelf  for  a
       number of years, which had 6 heads and  240  cylinders.  The  closest
       drive table entry on the XT controller was 6 heads and 400 cylinders.
    
          I was able to use the drive by doing a partial format of only  the
       first 240 cylinders, and establishing a primary DOS partition  (using
       FDISK) which was only 240  cylinders  in  size.  Thus,  although  the
       system thought it was a 400 cylinder drive, it never had  any  reason
       to attempt access to the cylinders which were not physically present.
    
          All of the above worked perfectly,  until  I  tried  to  park  the
       drive.... BUZZZZ... (Insert the sound  of  a  head  actuator  banging
       against the drive stop about 160 times).
    
          Since I had run into similar situations  (particularily  on  XT's)
       where I didn't always have a park utility which put  the  heads  away
       where I wanted, I decided to solve the problem once and for all,  and
       sat down and wrote the PARK.COM program described  on  the  following
       pages.
    
          The source code to PARK is provided in the file PARK.C, and may be
       re-compiled using my MICRO-C compiler (See enclosed CATALOG file). It
       MUST be complied in TINY model, which allows it to easily  write  out
       an updated copy of itself (See '-s' option).
    
          The program may be freely used and distributed, provided  that  my
       copyright notices are not removed or altered.

    2. PARK.COM
    
          The PARK.COM program  supplied  in  this  archive  allows  you  to
       specify the number of hard drives to park, and the cylinder number at
       which to park each drive.
    
          In its simplest form, the PARK command  consists  of  one  decimal
       operand for each drive in the system, which is the cylinder number at
       which to park the drive. If  you  specify  a  cylinder  number  of  0
       (zero), the highest cylinder number for that  drive  as  reported  by
       BIOS is used:
    
                PARK 0          ; Park drive C at highest known cylinder
                PARK 240        ; Park drive C at cylinder 240
                PARK 240 0      ; Park drive C at 240, drive D at highest
                PARK 240 400    ; Park drive C at 240, drive D at 400
    
          If the BIOS does not acknowledge the existance of a drive, it will
       be ignored. The last two examples above would be equivalent to  "PARK
       240" on a single drive system.
    
          PARK.COM supports a '-s' option, which causes it to  write  a  new
       PARK.COM which defaults to the remaining options. Executing PARK with
       no arguments will PARK at these default settings:
    
                PARK -s 240 0   ; Save the settings
                PARK            ; Park drive C at 240, drive D at highest
    
          You may see the currently defined default  settings  by  executing
       PARK with the '-s' option, and no other arguments:
    
                PARK -s         ; Display the default settings
    
          The PARK.COM program supplied in this archive is defaulted to  TWO
       drives, both of which are  parked  at  the  highest  cylinder  number
       indicated by BIOS. This is equivalent to:
    
                PARK -s 0 0     ; Default to drive C+D, highest cylinder
    
          PARK will display a brief help summary if you give it  an  operand
       of '?' or '-?'.
