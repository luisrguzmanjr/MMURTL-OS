This program displays any occurances of the first eight hardware
interrupts on the IBM PC, which signal various processor exceptions.

When HEM detects a hardware exception, It will open a small window
in the center of the screen, displaying what type of exception
has occured, and waits for you to press a key. After you press a key,
HEM will close the text window, and attempt to terminate the
application "gracefully" by exiting to DOS.

To install HEM, you must execute the program, and specify HOT-KEYS
on the command line as follows:
        L - Left SHIFT
        R - Right SHIFT
        A - ALT
        C - CONTROL
        S - SysRq (Caution: some systems may not like this one)

        eg: HEM LR  (Install with LEFT+RIGHT SHIFT for hotkeys)

Any time you 'POP-INTO' HEM with the HOT-KEYS, it will reclaim the
hardware interrupts. This allows you to bypass application programs
which take them over.
