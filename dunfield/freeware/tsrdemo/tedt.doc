TEDT is a small TSR text editor. It is based on my EDT editor, originally
written for UNIX. To port EDT to the PC, All I had to do was change the
calls to UNIX termcap library functions into MICRO-C video library calls.

To make EDT into a TSR (TEDT), I renamed the 'main' function to 'edt', added
code to prompt for the filename, and then added a new 'main' function which
determines the HOTKEYS, and uses the "tsr" function from the MICRO-C library
to cause "edt" to execute whenever those hotkeys are pressed. All in all,
about an hours work!!!

If HOTKEYS are specified on the command line,  TEDT will install itself as
a TSR (Ram-Resident) program, which can be invoked at any time by pressing
the HOTKEYS. Available HOTKEYS are:
        L - Left SHIFT
        R - Right SHIFT
        A - ALT
        C - CONTROL
        S - SysRq (Caution: some systems may not like this one)

        eg: TEDT LR (Install with LEFT+RIGHT SHIFT for hotkeys)

I have set the edit buffer size at 25K in this "demo" version... Perhaps
in the future I'll make it a command line option on installation.

To POP-UP, press the HOTKEYS... TEDT prompts you for the filename
(You must press Keypad '+' or F10 to enter it, the EDT input routines
use RETURN as just another text character). A zero length line gets
you back out immediatly. If TEDT cannot open the file, it assumes its
a NEW FILE... If in fact the name was invalid, you will get a warning
when you try to exit, and can still save your editing by specifing a
filename to the 'W' or 'X' commands.

TEDT only pops-up over TEXT screens, I have not yet implemented a test
for the video mode, so popping up over graphics WORKS, but you are
unable to see the edit session. If DO you inadvertantly POP-UP over
graphics, you will probably see corruption in the top portion of the
graphics image. In most cases, you can IMMEDIATLY press F10 to exit,
and restore the screen (If you get past the filename prompt into the
editor, you will have to feel your way around "blind" till you can exit.

The original MS-DOS EDT was compiled with TURBO-C, this version is compiled
with my MICRO-C, in order to take advantage of its built-in TSR library
functions. It is considerably smaller than the TC version (Even with all
the TSR and screen saving junk added, it came out over 4K smaller).
Additional code size reduction can be accomplished by removeing the
line-by-line mode of operation, but I havn't done this yet.

Due to differences in my MICRO-C video library .vs. my TC one, the
WORD-LEFT and WORD RIGHT functions as CONTROL-HOME and CONTROL-END
respectivly, previously unused F8 is used to refresh the screen in TEDT.

I have also removed the '$' execute SYSTEM command, since shelling to
another program from within a TSR is a very BAD thing to do...

The following is the documentation for the MS-DOS version of EDT, upon
which TEDT is based.

      EDT - Text editor
   
   1. Introduction
   
         EDT is a fully featured, in-memory, text editor.  It  operates  in
      either a line-by-line, or a visual screen format.
   
         In line-by-line mode, EDT performs no direct screen accesses,  and
      may be operated over a serial port using CTTY.
   
         EDT is invoked with the command 'EDT  <filename>'.  If  the  named
      file already exists, EDT will load and edit  it,  otherwise  a  blank
      file is presented. If the optional '-v' qualifier is  specified,  EDT
      will start-up in line-by-line mode, otherwise it starts up in  visual
      mode.
   
               eg:     edt thefile.dat         <- Visual mode
                       edt myfile.dat -v       <- Line by Line

   2. Line mode operation
   
      2.1 Line ranges
   
            Most commands  accept  a  "line-range"  which  is  an  optional
         specification controlling the range of lines for which the command
         has  effect.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  default  line-range
         assumed for each command is the "current" line (*).
   
            The "current" line is the line at which EDT  is  positioned  in
         line by line mode, and is also the line on  which  the  cursor  is
         positioned in visual mode.
   
            The following are the valid line range formats:
   
                  *        - The "current" line
                  /        - The entire file
                  =        - The tagged lines
                  0        - The end of the file
                  <n>      - Line number <n>, (<n> >= 1)
                  <r>,<r>  - Range between beginning of two other ranges.
   
            The '+' and '-' characters may be used to  add  or  subtract  a
         constant value from a line range.
   
                   eg: '0-12' <- 12 lines from end of file
   
            If '+' or '-' is used but no range is specified, an offset from
         the current line is assumed.
   
                 eg: '+12' <- 12 lines from the current line.
   
            The line range specification is entered immediately  preceeding
         the command name.
   
                        ie: '<r><command> <operands>'
   
      2.2 Line mode commands
         C - Copy text
   
               The 'C'opy command performs a copy of the  active  range  of
            lines, placeing the copy directly ahead of the current line.
   
            Examples:
   
                   C               - Duplicate current line
                   1,10C           - Copy lines 1 to 10 inclusive
                   =C              - Copy tagged lines
                   /C              - Duplicate entire file (must be at end)

         D - Delete text
   
               The 'D'elete command deletes the active range of lines.
   
            Examples:
   
                   D               - Delete current line
                   -5,+5D          - Delete 11 lines -5 to +5 from current
                   /D              - Delete entire file
   
         F - File information
   
               This command  displays  information  about  the  file  being
            edited, includes the filename, the size of the  file  in  lines
            and characters, and the size and position of the specified line
            range.
   
            Examples:
   
                   F               - Display file & current line information
                   =F              - Display file & tagged lines information
   
         I - Insert new text
   
               The 'I'nsert command prompts for 'Input:', and  inserts  all
            lines typed directly ahead of the active range.  Enter  a  null
            line to exit.
   
            Examples:
   
                   I               - Insert ahead of current line
                   /I              - Insert at start of file
                   0I              - Insert at end of file
   
         L - List text in simple form
   
               The 'L'ist command displays the active range of  lines.  The
            display does not include line numbers or  special  indications.
            'L'ist is faster and mode efficent that 'P'rint.
   
            Examples:
   
                   L               - List current line
                   /L              - List entire file
                   -10,+10L        - List 21 lines, centered on current
   
         M - Move text
   
               The 'M'ove command moves the active range of  lines  to  the
            location directly ahead of the current line.
   
            Examples:
   
                   =M              - Move tagged lines
                   +1M             - Interchange active & next line

         P - Print text (Enhanced 'L'ist)
   
               The 'P'rint command displays the active range of lines. This
            display includes the line number which may  be  preceded  by  a
            special indication flag ('*' for current line, '='  for  tagged
            lines).
   
            Examples:
   
                   P               - Display current line
                   /P              - Display entire file
   
         Q - Quit (exit) editor
   
               The 'Q'uit command exits the editor. This command  will  not
            allow an exit if unsaved changes are present in the file.
   
            Examples:
   
                   Q               - Quit editor
   
         QQ - Unconditional 'Q'uit
   
               The 'QQ'uit command exits the editor unconditionaly.
   
            Examples:
   
                   QQ              - Quit unconditionaly.
   
         R <filename> - Read file
   
               The  'R'ead  command  reads  the  entire  contents  of   the
            specified file, and inserts it directly  ahead  of  the  active
            range.
   
            Examples:
   
                   Rabc            - Insert file 'abc' at current
                   /Rabc           - Insert file 'abc' at start
                   0Rabc           - Append file 'abc' at end
   
         S<dc><search><dc><replace> - Substitute
   
               The 'S'ubstitute command searches the active range of lines,
            and replaces all occurrances of the string  <search>  with  the
            string <replace>. The  <dc>  delimiter  character  may  be  any
            character not contained within the <search> string.
   
            Examples:
   
                   S'abc'def       - Change 'abc' to 'def' in current
                   /S'abc'def      - Change 'abc' to 'def' in entire file
                   =S'abc'def      - Change 'abc' to 'def' in tagged lines

         T - Tag lines
   
               The 'T'ag command tags the active range of  lines,  allowing
            them to be referred to by '=' in a subsequent command range.
   
            Examples:
   
                   T               - Tag current line
                   1,10T           - Tag lines 1 to 10
                   *,+5T           - Tag six lines starting at current
   
         V - Switch Visual Mode
   
               The 'V' command causes EDT  to  switch  visual  modes.  This
            enters visual mode if EDT was previously in line by line  mode,
            and enters line by line mode if previously in visual mode.
   
            Examples:
   
                   V               - Switch visual modes
   
         W [filename] - Write to file
   
               The 'W' command writes the active  range  of  lines  to  the
            named file, or to the  original  file  edited  if  no  name  is
            specified. Use of this command also  resets  the  FILE  CHANGED
            flag, allowing exit via 'q'.
   
               The default line range assumed for  'W'rite  is  the  entire
            file.
   
            Examples:
   
                   W               - Write entire file
                   *W              - Write current line
                   Wabc            - Write entire file to 'abc'
                   =Wabc           - Write tagged lines to 'abc'
   
         X [filename] - Write file and eXit
   
               This  command  behaves  exactly  as  the  'W'rite   command,
            followed  immediatly  by  a  'Q'uit  command.  It  provides   a
            shorthand way of saving your file and leaving the editor.
   
            Examples:
   
                   X               - Write file & exit
                   Xabc            - Write to 'abc' and exit
   EDT Text Editor                                                  Page: 6


         ?<text> - Search for text
   
               The '?' command moves the active line to the first occurance
            of the specified string within the active range.
   
               The default range assumed for '?' is one character past  the
            current cursor position (in visual mode) or the first character
            of the active line (In line by line mode), through to  the  end
            of the file.
   
            Examples:
   
                   ?string         - Find next occurance of "string"
                   /?string        - Find first occurance of "string"
   
         $<command> - Execute DOS command
   
               The '$' command executes the specified DOS command.
   
            Examples:
   
                   $dir            - Execute 'dir' command
   
         <no command> - Goto line
   
               If a line  range  is  given  without  a  command,  EDT  will
            reposition the "current" line to the beginning of that range.
   
            Examples:
   
                   100             - Move to line 100
                   /               - Move to start of file
                   0               - Move to end of file
                   =               - Move to tagged line(s)

   3. Visual mode operation
   
         When in VISUAL mode, EDT presents a window on the terminal  screen
      which displays the contents of a section of the file. Editing of  the
      file may be performed directly on the  screen  via  special  function
      keys, and the screen is updated so that you see your changes as  they
      are being performed.
   
         Any control characters which exist in the file will  be  displayed
      as the corresponding printable character in reverse video.
   
         If the end of the file is within the area shown on the screen, the
      message '*EOF*' is displayed in reverse video.
   
      3.1 Entering text
   
            Text may be entered into  the  file  being  edited,  simply  by
         typeing it at the terminal keyboard. EDT automatically places  the
         text in the file, and  updates  the  screen  to  reflect  the  new
         contents. The  position  of  the  terminal  cursor  indicates  the
         position at which the text will be entered.
   
      3.2 Positioning the cursor
   
            The arrow keys on the terminal may be used to move  the  cursor
         around the displayed image. Moving beyond the bottom of the screen
         causes EDT to scroll forward one line, and shift  the  screen  up.
         Moving beyond the top of the screen causes EDT to scroll  backward
         one half screen, and redisplay the text.
   
            EDT will perform sideways scrolling of the display to allow the
         cursor to access the entire width of lines which are  larger  than
         80 columns.
   EDT Text Editor                                                  Page: 8


      3.3 Visual mode function keys
   
            The following keys on the IBM PC keyboard have special  meaning
         to EDT:
   
         Right arrow
   
               Moves the cursor forward one character positon in the  file,
            if at the end of a line, the cursor will advance to  the  first
            position of the next line.
   
         Left arrow
   
               Moves the cursor backward one character positon in the file,
            if at the beginning of a line, the cursor will  backup  to  the
            last position of the previous line.
   
         Up arrow
   
               Moves the cursor up one line. If at the top of  the  screen,
            the display will scroll backwards by one half a screen page.
   
         Down arrow
   
               Moves the cursor down one line. If  at  the  bottom  of  the
            screen, the display will scroll forward by one line.
   
               The cursor may appear to jump back and forth as it is  moved
            up and down, if it ancounters lines which are shorter than  the
            current character position within  the  line,  or  lines  which
            contain tabs. This is because whenever possible, the cursor  is
            returned to the same number of  physical  characters  from  the
            start of the line as is was on the first line from which the UP
            or DOWN arrow was pressed.

            bottom)
   
         Page down
   
               This key pages forward one screen. (Bottom line becomes top)
   
         Home
   
               Moves the cursor to the beginning of  the  line.  If  it  is
            already at the  beginning  of  a  line,  it  is  moved  to  the
            beginning of the previous line.
   
         End
   
               Moves the cursor to the end of the line. If already  at  the
            end of a line, it is moved to the end of the next line.
