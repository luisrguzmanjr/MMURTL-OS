    1. INTRODUCTION
    
          MICRO-Terminal is a tiny terminal program, which supports a subset
       of the ANSI control codes (Also known as VT100  control  codes),  and
       basic  XMODEM  binary  file  transfer.  The  MTERM.COM  program  file
       occupies only 10K of disk space, which makes it an ideal program  for
       use on a laptop or other floppy disk based system.
    
          It is also very useful  for  communciations  debugging,  since  it
       loads fast, is easy to setup, supports all asynchronous data formats,
       and has a TSR (POP-UP) mode which enables it to be kept in memory and
       activated with a simplle keypress combination.
    
          NOTE: MICRO-Terminal is a SUBSET of the  ANSI  specification,  and
       will not pass all of the "VT100 - Checkup" tests.
    
    2. Using MICRO-Terminal
    
       2.1 Normal mode
    
             The MICRO-Terminal program may be used in two ways,  the  first
          is as a "normal" DOS program. To activate MICRO-Terminal  in  this
          way, enter the command:
    
                                     MTERM
    
             This will load MICRO-Terminal, and present you  with  the  main
          function menu, allowing you to  access  its  freatures.  When  you
          select the "Exit to DOS" option, MICRO-Terminal will terminate  in
          the "normal" fashion, and return you to the DOS command prompt.
    
       2.2 POP-UP mode
    
             The second way to use  MICRO-Terminal  is  as  a  TSR  (POP-UP)
          program. To use this feature, you  must  specify  HOTKEYS  on  the
          command line. Available HOTKEYS are:
    
                L - Left SHIFT
                R - Right SHIFT
                A - ALT
                C - CONTROL
                S - SysRq (Caution: some systems may not like this one)
    
             For example:
    
                                    MTERM LR
    
             This  will  load  MICRO-Terminal  into  memory,  but  will  not
          activate it. You will immediately be returned to the  DOS  command
          prompt. Once MICRO-Terminal has been installed in  this  way,  you
          can "POP" into it simply by pressing the LEFT and RIGHT SHIFT keys
          at the same time. This allows MICRO-Terminal to be  accessed  from
          ANYWHERE (even if you  are  running  another  program).  When  you
          select the "Exit to DOS" function from the main menu, you will  be
          returned to whatever application  program  was  running  when  you
          "POPPED" in.

       2.3 The main menu
    
             When you enter MICRO-Terminal, it first  presents  you  with  a
          main menu, which allows you to access its  features,  through  the
          following selections:
    
          2.3.1 Terminal Emulation
    
                This selection causes MICRO-Terminal to begin emulating  the
             ANSI terminal, allowing you to send and  receive  data  to  and
             from the  COMM  port.  Press  CTRL-Home  or  CTRL-End  to  exit
             Terminal Emulation.
    
          2.3.2 XMODEM Download
    
                When you select this option, you  will  be  prompted  for  a
             filename. Once the filename  is  entered,  MICRO-Terminal  will
             begin receiving data into that file from the  COMM  port  using
             the XMODEM protocol. A status window is displayed  showing  the
             filename being written, the number of XMODEM  128  byte  blocks
             received, and any  error  conditions  which  occur  during  the
             download.
    
                You may press the <ESCAPE> key at  any  time  to  abort  the
             download, and return to the main menu. NOTE: It make take a few
             seconds from when you press <ESCAPE> until the download aborts.
    
          2.3.3 XMODEM Upload
    
                When you select this option, you  will  be  prompted  for  a
             filename. Once the filename  is  entered,  MICRO-Terminal  will
             begin transmitting the contents of that file to the  COMM  port
             using the XMODEM protocol. A status window is displayed showing
             the filename being transmitted, the number of XMODEM  128  byte
             blocks sent, and any error conditions which  occur  during  the
             upload.
    
                You may press the <ESCAPE> key at  any  time  to  abort  the
             upload, and return to the main menu. NOTE: It make take  a  few
             seconds from when you press <ESCAPE> until the upload aborts.
    
          2.3.4 Serial port config
    
                This selection presents you with a sub-menu which allows you
             to configure the COMM port,  baudrate,  number  of  data  bits,
             parity type, number of stop bits and XON/XOFF flow  control  to
             be used for the terminal session.
    
          2.3.5 Exit to DOS
    
                This selection terminates  the  main  menu,  and  exits  the
             MICRO-Terminal program.

    3. Keypad keys
    
          MICRO-Terminal maps the ANSI auxiliary keypad codes into  the  IBM
       PC keyboard using the following table:
    
                ANSI Key        IBM/PC Key      Code Transmitted
                ------------------------------------------------

                    9               F9              <ESC>Oy
                    -           Keypad '-'          <ESC>Om
                    ,           CTRL-PgUp           <ESC>Ol
                    .           CTRL-PgDn           <ESC>On
                  ENTER         Keypad '+'          <ESC>OM
                   PF1             Home             <ESC>OP
                   PF2             End              <ESC>OQ
                   PF3             PgUp             <ESC>OR
                   PF4             PgDn             <ESC>OS
    
    4. Control codes
    
          MICRO-Terminal  recognizes  the  following  subset  of  the   ANSI
       terminal command codes:
    
    
                Position cursor:        <ESC>[n;nH
                                        <ESC>[n;nf
                Clear to end of screen: <ESC>[J
                    "   "   "   "       <ESC>[0J
                Clear entire screen:    <ESC>[2J
                Clear to end of line:   <ESC>[K
                    "   "   "   "       <ESC>[0K
                Clear entire line:      <ESC>[2K
                Select normal video:    <ESC>[0m
              * Select underline:       <ESC>[4m
                Select reverse video:   <ESC>[7m
    
            * This works on monochrome displays only.
