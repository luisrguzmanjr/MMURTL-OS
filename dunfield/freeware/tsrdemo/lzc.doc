LaserJet Commander: Performs common operations on a LaserJet printer.

Use 'LZC' with no operands for NON-TSR operation.

If HOTKEYS are specified on the command line, LZC will install
itself as a TSR (Ram-Resident) program, which can be invoked at
any time by pressing the HOTKEYS. Available HOTKEYS are:
        L - Left SHIFT
        R - Right SHIFT
        A - ALT
        C - CONTROL
        S - SysRq (Caution: some systems may not like this one)

    eg: LZC LR (Install with LEFT+RIGHT SHIFT for hotkeys)

Once you have activated the program, you may use the up and down arrow
keys to select an operation, and press <enter> to perform that function.

<Home> and <End> will take you to the beginning and end of the list
(respectivly), Press <escape> to exit the menu.

All operations are performed on "LPT1".
