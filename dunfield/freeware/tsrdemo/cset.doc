Use 'cset' with no operands for NON-TSR operation.

If HOTKEYS are specified on the command line, CSET will install
itself as a TSR (Ram-Resident) program, which can be invoked at
any time by pressing the HOTKEYS. Available HOTKEYS are:
        L - Left SHIFT
        R - Right SHIFT
        A - ALT
        C - CONTROL
        S - SysRq (Caution: some systems may not like this one)

    eg: CSET LR (Install with LEFT+RIGHT SHIFT for hotkeys)
