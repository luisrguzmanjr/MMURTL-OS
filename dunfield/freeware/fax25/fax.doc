    2. SERIAL INTERFACE
    
          The FAXPHONE 25/FAX-225 features a simple three wire RS-232 serial
       interface for remote operation.
    
            Mode:       Asynchronous
            Speed:      4800 or 9600 baud
            Start bits: 1
            Data bits:  8
            Parity:     None
            Stop bits:  1
    
       2.1 Connector Pinout
    
             The  FAXPHONE  25/FAX-225  features  a  small  5-pin   circular
          connector which is located directly behind the handset jack. On my
          FAXPHONE 25, this connector was covered by a small  plastic  plate
          which had to be removed.
    
             The easiest way to connect to this interface is with  a  serial
          cable available from CANON. This  cable  converts  to  a  standard
          DB-25 female connector which can  be  directly  attached  to  most
          PC's.
    
             If you do not have this cable, the pinout for the FAX connector
          is as follows:
    
                            ______
                           /      \ 
                         /  1    2  \
                        |  3  []  4  |
                         \      5   /
                           \______/
    
    
                Pin     DB-25       Name
                 1        2         Transmit Data (TXD)
                 2        3         Receive  Data (RXD)
                 3        7         Signal Ground
                 4        1         Frame Ground
                 5        1         Frame Ground
    
             The CANON cable also ties pin 4(RTS) to  pin  5(CTS),  and  pin
          6(DSR) to pin 20(DTR) on the DB-25 connector.
    
             NOTE: For FAXPHONE 25, you should check the ROM revision number
          which is indicated on a round label affixed to the bottom  of  the
          unit (This is a small round sticker containing a number only).  If
          the number is 01-09, CANON requests that you contact  them  before
          attempting to  use  the  RS-232  interface.  My  FAXPHONE  25  has
          revision 11, and it appears to work OK.

       2.2 Activating the serial interface
    
             To enable the RS-232 interface, you must turn on DIP switch  #4
          on the bottom of the FAX unit. (My FAXPHONE 25  has  the  switches
          set to 0101 0000).
    
             To set the serial speed (baud rate):
    
            1.  Press [FUNCTION] and [4] to enter USER DATA
    
            2.  Press [0] until you see the message prompt
                "RS-232C BAUD RATE?".
    
            3.  Press [1] to active this function. The display
                will show the currently configured baud rate.
    
            4.  Press [0] to toggle to the next baud rate
                (4800/9600). Press [1] when the speed you
                want is displayed.
    
             To enter RS-232 Remote  Mode  (and  accept  commands  from  the
          serial port):
    
            1.  Press [FUNCTION] and [4] to enter USER DATA
    
            2.  Press [0] until you see the message prompt
                "RS-232C Remove Mode?".
    
            3.  Press [1] to active remote mode.
                The IN USE indicator will light.
    
            4.  To cancel Remote Mode, press the red STOP button.

    3. SERIAL FAX COMMANDS
    
          The FAXPHONE  25/FAX-225  accepts  and  acts  upon  commands  when
       operating in its RS-232  Remote  mode.  Most  useful  functions  will
       require several of these commands to perform.
    
          The FAX has a short  timeout  for  receiving  commands  and  their
       responses, which makes it difficult to manually enter  the  commands.
       In most cases, you will need to use a program to send and  coordinate
       the proper sequence of commands to accomplish a particular function.
    
          Although the command code appear to be simple parameter lists, the
       CANON documents do not identify the individual  value  meanings,  but
       define only the following command strings:
    
       3.1 Load Font
    
             Loads a text font into the  FAX  machine.  This  must  be  done
          before any operations involving text are performed.
    
                Send:       CC=010704/CD=01/FN=00//
                Receive:    ACK
                Send:       DT=<font data>EOP
                Receive:    ACK
    
             <font data> consists of 96  character  entries  each  of  which
          consists of 48 bytes, for a total of 4608 bytes of data.
    
             Each character is 16 bits wide, by 24 bits high. Each  pair  of
          bytes in an entry represent one line, beginning at the top of  the
          character.
    
       3.2 Load Text
    
             Loads a text file into the FAX machine, for later  printing  or
          transmission. You must load a font prior to using this command.
    
                Send:       CC=010704/CD=00/FN=10//
                Receive:    ACK
                Send:       DT=<text data>EOP
                Receive:    ACK
    
             <text data> consists of ASCII text  (character  values  between
          SPACE 0x20 and DEL 0x7F only). Each line terminates with  CARRIAGE
          RETURN (0x0D) and LINE FEED (0x0A), each page ends with FORM  FEED
          (0x0C).
    
             A maximum of 100K of text may be loaded at any one time.
    
             Maximum line length is 100 characters.

       3.3 Transfer Image
    
             Transfers a compressed image (using MH method) to or  from  the
          FAX machine.
    
                Send:       CC=010704/CD=03/FN=15//
                Receive:    ACK
                Send:       DT=<image data>[MPS or EOP]
                Receive:    ACK
    
                            -- OR --
    
                Send:       CC=010407/CD=03/FN=15//
                Receive:    ACK
                Receive:    DT=<image data>[MPS or EOP]
                Send:       ACK
    
             <image data> is compressed using the MH method. MH data is sent
          out byte-by-byte in the CCITT T4 format. MH data is compressed  in
          Huffman's code. Thus, the last byte of  a  line  does  not  always
          contain 8 bits. If the last byte does not contain 8  bits,  insert
          '0' in the remaining bits of the byte.
    
             To indicate the beginning of a page,  sent  the  following  EOL
          code before the data: [0x00, 0x80]
    
             To indicate the end of a line, add the following  EOL  code  to
          the end of each line: [0x00, 0x80]
    
             To indicate the end of a page, add the following  RTC  code  to
          the last line (9 bytes): [0x00,  0x08,  0x80,  0x00,  0x08,  0x80,
          0x00, 0x08, 0x80]
    
             Use MPS to indicate more  pages  are  to  follow.  Use  EOP  to
          terminate the last page. Up to 108K of image data may be loaded.
    
                [DT=<1st page>RTC][MPS][.. ..<last page>RTC][EOP]

       3.4 Load Destination
    
             Loads the FAX with 16 identifiers  which  indicate  speed  call
          keys to be used as the destinations for transmitted FAX's.
    
                Send:       CC=010704/CD=00/FN=40//
                Receive:    ACK
                Send:       DT=<destination data>EOP
                Receive:    ACK
    
             <destination data> consists of  16  two  bytes  pairs,  plus  a
          trailing 0xCC byte for a total of 33 bytes.
    
             The first byte of each pair indicates the type  of  speed  call
          key, the second indicates the actual key to be used:
    
                        Byte 1           Byte 2

       3.5 Transfer Telephone
    
             Transfers telephone number information to or from the FAX. This
          command loads/queries the ONE TOUCH and CODED speed call numbers.
    
                Send:       CC=010704/CD=00/FN=20//
                Receive:    ACK
                Send:       DT=<tel data>EOP
                Receive:    ACK
    
    
                        -- OR --
    
                Send:       CC=010407/CD=00/FN=20//
                Receive:    ACK
                Receive:    DT=<tel data>EOP
                Send:       ACK
    
             <tel data> consists of several groups, totaling 1371 bytes.
    
             The first group (192 bytes) is ONE TOUCH SPEED DIALING FOR FAX.
          It consists of 12 entries (For keys 0-9, # and *), each  of  which
          begins with 0x00, followed by 15 bytes containing up to 30  digits
          (in BCD) format. Use 0x0C for  any  digits  which  are  not  used,
          0x0E=Pause, and 0x0F= Space.
    
             If the A,B and C keys are configured for ONE TOUCH DIALING, the
          second group consists of three more entries (as above) except that
          each entry is 33 bytes long (0x00 + 32 bytes).
    
             If the A,B and C keys are configured  for  GROUP  DIALING,  the
          second group consists of 3 entries, each of which contains 16  X-Y
          pairs (See LOAD DESTINATION), and a trailing 0xCC byte  (total  99
          bytes).
    
             The third group (6 bytes) contains the configuration of the  A,
          B and C keys. The first three bytes contains the type for each key
          (0x00=Speed dial, 0x01=Group dial). the second three bytes conains
          the number of group  dialing  destinations  registered  under  the
          corresponding key.
    
             The forth group (15 bytes) is used to identify  keys  used  for
          RELAY or CONFIDENTIAL document  sending  for  the  one-touch  keys
          (0-9, #, *, A-C). Bit 7 of each byte indicates RELAY sending,  and
          bit 6 indicates CONFIDENTIAL sending for each respective key.
    
             The fifth group  (15  bytes)  contains  information  about  the
          confidential mailbox numbers of the one-touch  keys  (0-9,  #,  *,
          A-C), used for sending confidential documents. Each entry contains
          the mailbox number for the respective key  (in  BCD  format).  Two
          bytes of zero follow this data

             The sixth group (240 bytes), is ONE  TOUCH  SPEED  DIALING  FOR
          VOICE. It consists of 15 entries, each of which begins with  0x00,
          followed by 15 bytes containing up to 30 BCD digits. The format is
          the same as for the first group listed in this section.
    
             The seventh group (800 bytes) contains 50 entries for the CODED
          SPEED DIALING keys. Each entry begins with 0x00,  followed  by  15
          bytes containing up to 30 BCD digits. Format is the  same  as  the
          first group listed in this section.

       3.6 Transfer Special Telephone
    
             Loads telephone number information into "special"  Coded  speed
          dial numbers (51-66) which are only accessable through the  RS-232
          port. These make good "scratchpad" locations  to  store  telephone
          numbers that are being specified from the serial port.
    
                Send:       CC=010704/CD=00/FN=50//
                Receive:    ACK
                Send:       DT=<tel data>EOP
                Receive:    ACK
    
        <tel data> consists of 16 entries, each of which is 16 bytes
    long (total 256 bytes). Each entry begins with 0x00, followed by 15
    bytes containing up to 30 digits (in BCD) format. Use 0x0C for any
    digits which are not used, 0x0E=Pause, and 0x0F=Space.
    
        Note that the "memory protect" switch must be OFF to be able
    to load the telephone numbers.

    5. CONTROL CODES
    
       5.1 Fax Control Codes
    
             The following character codes are used as  control  information
          during communication with the FAXPHONE 25/FAX-225:
    
        MPS     0x02            Multi-Page Signal
                                Indicates the image data for this page
                                ends, and the image data for the next
                                page follows without a change in
                                transmission mode.
    
        EOP     0x04            End of Procedure
                                Used to terminate all data entries to
                                The FAX machine.
    
        ACK     0x06            Acknowledge
                                Indicates that data or commands have
                                been received without error.
    
        NAK     0x15            Negative Acknowledge
                                Indicates that data or commands have
                                not been received properly.
    
       5.2 Printer Control Codes
    
             The  following  character  codes  are  interpreted  as  special
          actions during the reception of ASCII text:
    
        HT      0x09            Horizontal Tab
                                Advances the print position to the next
                                TAB position, which are preset every 8
                                character spaces.
    
        LF      0x0A            Line feed
                                Advances the print position to the next
                                line while remaining at the same column.
    
        FF      0x0C            Form Feed
                                Causes the FAX to cut the recording paper
                                and begin a new page.
    
        CD      0x0D            Carriage Return
                                Moves the print position to the beginning
                                of the current line.

    6. ERROR CODES
    
          When an error condition occurs, the FAXPHONE  25/FAX-225  emits  a
       loud beeping, and displays the  following  error  codes  on  the  LCD
       display in the form "ONLINE ERROR nn":
    
        00          Data error during reception
                    Overrun or Framing error occured on the data
                    stream from the RS-232 imput.
    
        04          Input/Output Data Error
                    The FAX did not receive data within 30 seconds
                    from a time when it was expected from the
                    computer.
    
        07          Receive buffer overflow
                    The computer has sent more than 100K bytes of
                    data to the FAX, and has overflowed memory.
    
        10          Command/Parameter error
                    There is an error in either the command code or

    7. CHARACTER FONTS
    
          The  FAXPHONE  25/FAX-225  has  no  internal  knowledge  of   what
       characters received from the RS-232 port should look like. This means
       that before you perform any operations which use character data,  you
       need to download a FONT, which describes the exact bitmap image to be
       used for each printable character.
    
          See the "Load Font" command for information on  the  format  of  a
       font file.
    
       7.1 Pre-defined Fonts
    
             The following fonts are included in this archive:
    
            HIGHRES .FNT    -   A reasonable high resolution font which I
                                created using the FONT EDITOR.
    
            MATRIX  .FNT    -   This is a basic 8x8 character matrix font,
                                which I converted to the 16x24 format used
                                by the FAXPHONE 25/FAX-225. It is still an
                                8x8 font, and gives a "dot-matrix" look.
    
            MEDRES  .FNT    -   This is a version of MATRIX which has been
                                edited to increase its point resolution.
    
            THINLINE.FNT    -   My first attempt at a high resolution font.
                                This one has very thin character lines, which
                                has the effect of producing very light text.
    
       7.2 The Font Editor
    
             You can create new fonts and edit the existing fonts  using  my
          FONT EDITOR, which is supplied as the program FE.COM. The  program
          is fairly self explainitory. Just run it and specify the  name  of
          the file containing the font as an argument.

    8. EXAMPLE PROGRAM
    
          Included in this archive  is  a  simple  program  (FAX.COM)  which
       performs the basic operations available on the FAX machine.  The  'C'
       source code for this program is also included (FAX.C), for use as  an
       "example" of RS-232 communication with the FAX.
    
          This program (FAX.C) was written using my MICRO-C compiler,  which
       is a shareware product available from me. See  the  included  CATALOG
       file for more information.
    
          The basic operations performed by FAX.COM are:
    
       8.1 SCAN Document
    
             Syntax: FAX SC <filename>
    
    
             The document is scanned by the FAX machine, and loaded into the
          specified file.
    
       8.2 PRINT TEXT File
    
             Syntax: FAX PT <filename> [font file]
    
             The  specified  file  is  printed  as  ASCII  text,  using  the
          specified  FONT.  If  no  FONT  is  given,  the  default  used  is
          MEDRES.FNT.
    
       8.3 PRINT IMAGE File
    
             Syntax: FAX PI <filename>
    
             The previously scanned image file is printed on the FAX.
    
       8.4 SEND TEXT Fax
    
             Syntax: FAX ST <filename> <tel #> [font file]
    
             The specified file  is  sent  as  an  ASCII  text  FAX  to  the
          specified telephone number. The telephone number may  contain  the
          digits 0-9, 'P' or ',' may be used to indicate a  PAUSE,  and  any
          other character is treated as a space. If not FONT  is  givem  the
          default used is MEDRES.FNT.
    
       8.5 SEND IMAGE Fax
    
             Syntax: FAX SI <filename> <tel #>
    
             The previously scanned image file is  send  as  a  FAX  to  the
          specified telephone number. The telephone number may  contain  the
          digits 0-9, 'P' or ',' may be used to indicate a  PAUSE,  and  any
          other character is treated as a space.
