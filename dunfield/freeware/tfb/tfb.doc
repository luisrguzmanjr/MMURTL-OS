TFB: A Tsr File Browser

   This is a small file viewing utility, that can be installed as a TSR,
allowing you to view files from within most other DOS applications. Its
main features are:

 - Small! (< 10K .COM file)
 - Can be installed as TSR, or run as standard DOS command.
 - View files up to 65535 lines (no other size limit).
 - You can have up to 10 "place markers" per file.
 - Remembers where you are in up to 10 separate files, allowing you to
   pop up and down, and switch between them without losing your place.
   Position, Place markers, Tab size, Search string etc. are stored and
   recalled when you select another file from the "pick list".

TFB command syntax:

   TFB [/ACLRS] [filename]

   [/ACLRS] = Hotkeys for TSR operation.
     A=Alt, C=Ctrl, L=LeftShift, R=RightShift, S=SysReq*
         *=SysReq may not work on some systems
     If no hotkeys are specified, TFB runs as a normal DOS command.

   [filename] = Initial file to browse
     If not given, TFB will prompt for the file (in TSR operation,
     this prompt will occur the first time you "pop-up").

While inside the TFB main display screen, you can use the following keys:

   Up       - Backup display on line.
   Down     - Advance display one line.
   Left     - Shift display one column to the Left.
   Right    - Shift display one column to the right.
   PgUp     - Backup display one screen (23 lines).
   PgDn     - Advance display one screen (23 lines).
   Home     - Shift display 20 columns to the left.
   End      - Shift display 20 columns to the right.
   CTL-Home - Position display to column one.
   CTL-PgUp - Position display to beginning of file.
   CTL-PgDn - Position display to end of file.
   F1       - Display Function Key summary.
   F2       - Prompt for line# and go to line.
   F3       - Prompt for string and search (from current line).
   F4       - Repeat last search (from current line + 1).
   F5       - Position to tagged line number.
   F6       - Set a tag at current line number.
   F7       - Prompt for new TAB spacing.
   F8       - Change screen colors.
   F9       - Open another file.
   F10      - "Pick" list of last 10 files opened.
   ESC      - Exit TFB

Misc Notes:

 - Most functions may be aborted by the ESCAPE key.

 - TFB re-opens the file every time you "pop-up" or "pick" a new file.
   This allows it to not have any files open when it is inactive. If you
   plan to "cd" to another directory, you should specify the entire
   pathname for any files that you open. If TFB pops up and cannot find
   the file you were last viewing, you will be prompted to enter a new one.

 - If you modify a file that you are viewing, you should re-select it from
   the "pick list", so that TFB will re-index it, and insure that the line
   numbers are correct.

 - In order that you may pop up and down quickly, TFB does not prompt for
   confirmation before exiting. If you are running it as a TSR, simply
   press your hotkeys again, and you will be right back where you were
   before pressing ESC.

TFB makes it easy to view our online .DOC files while working in your
favorite editor (or other environment). It is also particularly useful
with our DDS development kits, for referencing source files from within
monitors or other debuggers. For example, to compile an 8051 'C' program
(in small model), and view a complete assembly language listing with 'C'
source code as comments, and showing memory addresses, you could use:

          CC51 myprog m=s -cl      /* Compile & generate .LST file */
          TFB/RL myprog.lst        /* Load TFB with listing file */
          ... Download "myprog.hex" to target, and debug program ...
          ... Press SHIFT-SHIFT to view listing / 'C' source ...
          ... Use "pick" list to view include, library etc. ...
          ... Press ESCAPE to return to debugger ...
