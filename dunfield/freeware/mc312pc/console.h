/*
 * Compatibility definitions for the "CONSOLE" interface.
 *
 * The "CONSOLE" interface has been renamed to "VIDEO", and the function
 * names renamed to be consistant with the "WINDOW" library. This header
 * file maps the "VIDEO" functions back to the "CONSOLE" names, and allows
 * previously written MICRO-C programs, which use that interface to compile
 * correctly.
 *
 * When coding a program for the first time under MICRO-C, DO NOT USE THIS
 * FILE. Learn the "VIDEO" functions, since they are now standard.
