MICRO-C: Using multiple configurations, Debug, ROM etc.

Often with MICRO-C, you have two or more systems configurations that you
wish to use on a regular basis. For example, you might want to compile
for testing in RAM under a debug monitor, and then compile directory for
ROM.

If you are like most programmers, you will do most of your compiling for
testing under a debug monitor, and only infrequently will you want to
generate the final code for ROM. If this is the case, you can simply
configure your library (See READ.ME in library subdirectory) for the
memory addresses used in the debug version. When you wish to create a ROM
version, compile the program with the '-x' option (to create a full
assembly listing file), edit the .ASM file to change the addresses to the
ROM system, and assemble the file manually:

    CC11 myprog         ; Compile for debugging

    CC11 myprog -x      ; Compile to assembly
    edt myprog.asm      ; Edit to change memory addresses
    asm11 myprog        ; Assemble to ROM image

If you frequently compile for different system configurations, the above
approach can become quite tedious. In this case, edit the library startup
files to use EQU's for all memory addresses, and then place those EQU's in
a separate startup file, which is defined at the TOP of the SLINK external
index file (Note that you can have multiple startup files):

    <SYSTEM.ASM         ; System memory equates and code ORG
    <6811RLP.ASM        ; Remainder of startup file
    ...

All you have to do now, is change the file SYSTEM.ASM. This can be
accomplished with a simple batch file to copy one of several "canned"
system EQU files:

mcconfig.bat:
    @echo OFF                                   ; DOS 3.3 and later only!
    copy \MC\LIB11\%1.ASM \MC\LIB11\SYSTEM.ASM  ; Copy in configuration

debug.asm:
    ?RAM    EQU     $2000       ; Data RAM start address
    ?RAMEND EQU     $7FFF       ; Data RAM end address
            ORG     $0100       ; Origin code in RAM

rom.asm:
    ?RAM    EQU     $0000       ; Data RAM start address
    ?RAMEND EQU     $7FFF       ; Data RAM end address
            ORG     $E000       ; Origin code in ROM

Now, you can switch to the canned configurations with:

    C:\MC> mcconfig debug       ; Select DEBUG configuration
    C:\MC> mcconfig rom         ; Select ROM configuration

Using the above technique, you can have as many setup configurations as
you wish, each one stored in a small file. A variation of the system can
be used to replace the entire startup files (or any other portion of the
library) if your system configuration differences require that.
