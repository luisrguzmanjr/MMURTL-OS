MX-11 Multitasking Executive for the MC68HC11               12/14/93

Version 1.

This is the first release of the MX-11 Multitasking Executive for the
MC68HC11.  It is to be used with Dunfield Development Systems MICRO-C.

It should have been unzipped with the -d option to preserve the
directory structure.

The file MX.DOC describes how to use MX-11.

The file MXQUICK.DOC has a summary of the function calls provided
in MX-11.

The files in the obj directory should be copied to your MICRO-C/11
library (usually \mc\lib11).

The files in the src directory are the files that were compressed
with sconvert to obtain those in the obj directory.

Term.com is a simple communication program that I use to download S19
files to the 68HC11.  It uses COM1 at 9600 bps.

I hope this is useful to you. If you have any comments, requests or find
any bugs please contact me.
