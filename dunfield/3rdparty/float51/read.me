This MICRO-C callable floating point library for use on the 8051 was submitted
by one of our customers, and appears to work quite well. At present, it works
only in TINY, SMALL or COMPACT memory models. This is mostly due to accessing
of static data with MOVC. It should not be too difficult to modify the library
for use in MEDIUM or LARGE memory models.

A sample "floating point calculator" program is provided which demonstrates
the use of the floating point library: FTEST.C

I have cleaned up the code and formatted it in a manner consistant with
the DDS example programs, however: This is NOT a supported DDS product....
YOU ARE ON YOU OWN!
